      "notes": "**\"Logos\" (v. 1, 10)**: The Greek term is retained as a loanword. For a first-century reader, *Logos* carried immense weight, signaling the divine rational principle that orders the universe (Hellenistic philosophy) and the creative, personified \"Word\" of God found in the Hebrew scriptures and Wisdom literature. Translating it simply as \"Word\" flattens these essential metaphysical and theological connotations.\n\n**\"Gazed upon and... touched\" (v. 1)**: The author uses increasingly tactile and intensive verbs (*theaomai* and *pselaphao*). While \"seen\" refers to physical sight, \"gazed upon\" suggests a deliberate, contemplative observation. \"Touched\" or \"handled\" emphasizes the physical reality of the Logos, likely countering early Docetic tendencies that suggested Jesus was a spirit without a physical body.\n\n**\"Life of the coming age\" (v. 2)**: The Greek *zōēn tēn aiōnion* is traditionally \"eternal life.\" However, in the Jewish and early Christian context, *aiōnios* refers specifically to the *Aeon* (the Age to Come). It is a qualitative term rather than just a quantitative one, referring to the life that belongs to God's future kingdom, now made available in the present.\n\n**\"Shared life of participation\" (v. 3, 6, 7)**: The Greek *koinōnia* is often translated as \"fellowship,\" but in modern English, \"fellowship\" has been reduced to social interaction. In the first century, *koinōnia* implied a deep partnership, a sharing of resources, or a common life. The translation \"shared life of participation\" attempts to capture this sense of a joint-participation in the divine life.\n\n**\"Living out the truth\" (v. 6)**: The Greek *poioumen tēn alētheian* (\"doing the truth\") is a Semitic idiom (common in the Septuagint and the Dead Sea Scrolls). It reflects the Hebrew concept of *emet*, where truth is not merely a cognitive category or a set of correct facts, but a way of acting and living in faithfulness to God.\n\n**\"Sin-principle\" (v. 8)**: The Greek uses the singular *hamartian* (sin) without a definite article. In Johannine thought, this often refers to the internal power or root of sin (the \"sin-nature\"), whereas the plural *hamartias* in verse 9 refers to the specific acts of wrongdoing.\n\n**\"Acknowledge\" (v. 9)**: The Greek *homologōmen* literally means \"to say the same thing.\" In a judicial or relational context, it means to agree with God’s assessment of one's actions, rather than just \"confessing\" in a narrow, ritualistic sense."

While \"Helper\" or \"Comforter\" are used in John's Gospel, the context here with \"the Father\" and \"the Righteous One\" suggests a forensic or intercessory role in the face of sin.\n\n**\"Atoning sacrifice\" (v. 2)**: The word *hilasmos* refers to the means by which sins are covered or the divine displeasure is averted. It denotes the removal of the barrier between God and humanity.\n\n**\"Guards\" (v. 3, 4)**: The verb *tēreō* is often translated as \"keep,\" but it carries a nuance of guarding, watching over, or preserving something of great value.\n\n**\"Brought to its goal\" (v. 5)**: *Teteleiōtai* (from *teleioō*) means to complete, mature, or bring to an intended end. \"Perfected\" in modern English often implies moral flawlessness, whereas the Greek implies reaching the intended destination or full expression of love.\n\n**\"Brother\" (v. 9-11)**: In the context of the Johannine community, *adelphos* (\"brother\") is a kin-term for a fellow believer. It includes both men and women, but \"brother\" is retained here to preserve the family-metaphor consistent with \"children\" and \"fathers.\"\n\n**\"Empty pride of one's lifestyle\" (v. 16)**: *Alazoneia tou biou* refers to an ostentatious or arrogant display of one's possessions, status, or resources. It is the vaunting of the means of life.\n\n**\"Anointing\" (v. 20, 27)**: *Chrisma* refers to an application of oil, signifying the reception of the Holy Spirit. It is a wordplay on \"Christ\" (*Christos*), the \"Anointed One.\"\n\n**\"Fathered by him\" (v. 29)**: *Gegennētai* refers to the act of procreation or birth. \"Born of him\" is common, but \"fathered\" emphasizes the source of life and the paternal relationship established in the preceding verses."

      "notes": "**\"Extraordinary kind of love\" (v. 1)**: The Greek *potapēn* suggests more than just \"how great.\" It conveys a sense of wonder at something foreign or otherworldly—\"from what country or planet?\" It emphasizes the unique quality and origin of the Father's love.\n\n**\"Lawlessness\" (v. 4)**: The term *anomia* is more specific than general wrongdoing. It refers to a state of being \"without law\" or in active rebellion against God’s order. John equates the essence of sin with this fundamental rejection of divine authority.\n\n**\"Continues to sin / Practices sin\" (v. 6, 8, 9)**: The Greek uses the present tense (e.g., *hamartanei*, *poiōn tēn hamartian*), which in this context denotes habitual, characteristic action. Translating these as \"continues to sin\" or \"practices sin\" distinguishes the believer’s struggle with occasional sin from the unregenerate person’s life-defining orientation toward sin.\n\n**\"Undo\" (v. 8)**: The verb *lysē* means to \"loose,\" \"untie,\" or \"dissolve.\" While often translated \"destroy,\" \"undo\" captures the sense of unraveling or dismantling the structures and effects of the devil’s work.\n\n**\"God’s seed\" (v. 9)**: *Sperma* refers to the principle of divine life implanted in the believer. It is the internal catalyst that makes the life of sin incompatible with the new birth.\n\n**\"Slaughtered\" (v. 12)**: The verb *esphaxen* is a visceral term often used for the sacrificial cutting of an animal's throat. It suggests a violent, bloody murder, heightening the contrast with the \"righteous\" deeds of Abel.\n\n**\"World’s means of survival\" (v. 17)**: The Greek *bion tou kosmou* refers to the material resources necessary for life (food, clothing, money). It is distinct from *zoē* (the principle of life) or *psychē* (the individual life/soul).\n\n**\"Deep compassion\" (v. 17)**: *Splagchna* literally refers to the \"inward parts\" or \"bowels,\" which the ancients regarded as the seat of the most intense emotions. \"Deep compassion\" or \"gut-level pity\" is the English equivalent.\n\n**\"Bold confidence\" (v. 21)**: *Parrēsian* refers to freedom of speech or the \"unreservedness\" one has in the presence of a king or a friend. It is the opposite of the shrinking back caused by a condemning heart.\n\n**\"Put our trust in the name\" (v. 23)**: The aorist *pisteusōmen* combined with the dative \"name\" implies a decisive act of allegiance and reliance upon the person and authority of Jesus Christ."

      "notes": "**\"Test the spirits\" (v. 1)**: The Greek *dokimazete* refers to the process of assaying metals to determine their purity. In this context, it suggests a rigorous evaluation of the source of a prophet's inspiration.\n\n**\"In real human flesh\" (v. 2)**: The phrasing *en sarki elēlythota* (\"having come in flesh\") is a specific polemic against Docetism, an early heresy suggesting Jesus only *seemed* to have a physical body. The translation adds \"real human\" to emphasize the ontological weight the author is placing on the incarnation.\n\n**\"Fathered by God\" (v. 7)**: The Greek *gegennētai* (from *gennaō*) can mean \"born\" or \"begotten.\" Given the patriarchal lineage context of the first century, the image is that of God as the source of life, literally \"siring\" the believer into a new nature.\n\n**\"Unique, one-and-only\" (v. 9)**: The term *monogenē* is traditionally \"only begotten,\" but in Koine Greek, it emphasizes uniqueness and being \"one of a kind.\" It marks the Son as being in a category of his own.\n\n**\"Atoning sacrifice\" (v. 10)**: The Greek *hilasmon* is related to the *hilasterion* (the \"mercy seat\" or \"place of atonement\" in the LXX). It refers to the means by which a rupture in a relationship is repaired and sins are covered or removed.\n\n**\"Brought to its full maturity\" (v. 12, 17, 18)**: The root *teleioō* does not mean \"perfection\" in the sense of being without a flaw (the modern English sense), but rather \"reaching its intended end\" or \"becoming complete/mature.\" \n\n**\"Bold confidence\" (v. 17)**: The Greek *parrēsian* originally referred to the \"freedom of speech\" a citizen had in a Greek democratic assembly. Here, it denotes the lack of dread or the \"boldness\" a believer has when standing before God's judgment.\n\n**\"Expectation of punishment\" (v. 18)**: The word *kolasin* refers to punishment or correction. The text implies that fear exists because of the anticipation of a penalty.\n\n**\"Brother and sister\" (v. 20-21)**: While the Greek *adelphon* is masculine (\"brother\"), it was standard usage in early Christian communities to refer to the entire \"family\" of believers. In a modern context, \"brother and sister\" accurately reflects the communal and familial scope the author intended."

      ],
      "notes": "**\"Begotten\" (v. 1, 18)**: The Greek *gennaō* can mean \"born\" or \"begotten.\" In this context, the author uses the imagery of lineage and parentage to describe the relationship between God, Jesus (the One begotten), and the believer (those begotten). Using \"begotten\" preserves the internal logic of verse 1, where loving the \"one who begot\" (the Father) naturally leads to loving the \"one begotten\" (the child/fellow believer).\n\n**\"Heavy burden\" (v. 3)**: The Greek *bareiai* means heavy, weighty, or troublesome. In a Jewish context, this alludes to the \"yoke\" of the law. The author is asserting that the commandments of God, summarized by love, are not an exhausting or crushing weight compared to other religious or worldly obligations.\n\n**\"Conquers\" (v. 4-5)**: The verb *nikaō* carries a sense of prevailing in a struggle or winning a victory in a contest or battle. \"Overcome\" is a traditional rendering, but \"conquer\" better captures the decisive, active triumph intended by the author.\n\n**\"Water and blood\" (v. 6)**: This is a highly debated phrase. In the historical context of the Johannine community, it likely refutes an early form of Gnosticism (Docetism or Cerinthianism) which claimed Jesus received the \"Christ-spirit\" at his baptism (water) but that the divine element departed before his suffering (blood). The author insists Jesus is Christ in both his baptism and his sacrificial death.\n\n**\"Agreement\" (v. 8)**: Literally \"the three are into the one\" (*eis to hen eisin*). This is an idiom meaning they converge on the same point or speak with one voice.\n\n**\"Boldness\" (v. 14)**: The Greek *parrhēsia* refers to freedom of speech or the confidence a citizen had to speak plainly before an authority. In the New Testament, it describes the believer’s lack of fear in approaching God.\n\n**\"The One begotten by God\" (v. 18)**: There is a subtle but vital shift in the Greek. The first phrase \"everyone begotten by God\" (*pas ho gegennēmenos*) is a perfect participle referring to the believer. The second phrase \"the One begotten by God\" (*ho gennētheis*) is an aorist participle, which many scholars (and the SBLGNT text) identify as a reference to Jesus Christ, the unique Son who protects the believer. \n\n**\"Capacity to perceive\" (v. 20)**: The Greek *dianoia* refers to the faculty of understanding, the mind, or the intellectual capacity to process truth. It is not just \"knowledge\" (*gnōsis*), but the God-given ability to recognize and understand reality.\n\n**\"The True One\" (v. 20)**: The Greek *ton alēthinon* refers to God the Father. The verse concludes by identifying this reality—being in the Father and the Son—as the \"true God and eternal life.\""
