      "notes": "**\"Graced one\" (v. 28)**: The Greek κεχαριτωμένη is a perfect passive participle from χαριτόω, meaning \"one who has been graced/favored.\" This creates wordplay with χαῖρε (\"rejoice\") and χάρις (\"grace/favor\" in v. 30) that is impossible to fully preserve in English. \"Graced one\" attempts to retain the verbal connection better than the traditional \"favored one.\"\n\n**\"Slave\" (v. 38, 48)**: Greek δούλη is consistently rendered \"slave\" rather than \"servant\" or \"handmaid.\" In the ancient Mediterranean context, δοῦλος/δούλη specifically meant a slave—someone with no autonomous rights who belonged entirely to their master. Mary's self-designation is a profound statement of complete availability to God's purposes.\n\n**\"Strong drink\" (v. 15)**: Greek σίκερα is a Semitic loanword (Hebrew שֵׁכָר) referring to fermented beverages other than grape wine. The prohibition echoes the Nazirite vow (Numbers 6:3).\n\n**\"Overshadow\" (v. 35)**: Greek ἐπισκιάζω carries connotations of divine presence, evoking the cloud that overshadowed the tabernacle (Exodus 40:35 LXX uses the same verb). This is not language of sexual conception but of God's glory taking up residence.\n\n**\"No word from God will be impossible\" (v. 37)**: The Greek ῥῆμα means both \"word\" and \"thing/matter.\" The statement echoes Genesis 18:14 LXX (regarding Sarah's conception) and intentionally carries the double meaning: every divine word will be accomplished; nothing is impossible for God.\n\n**\"Compassionate mercy\" (v. 78)**: Greek σπλάγχνα ἐλέους literally means \"intestines/bowels of mercy\"—the ancients located deep emotion in the gut. \"Compassionate mercy\" attempts to convey the visceral, deeply felt nature of God's mercy.\n\n**\"Dawn from on high\" (v. 78)**: Greek ἀνατολή means \"rising\" and can refer to the sunrise or to a branch/shoot. It likely carries messianic overtones (cf. Zechariah 3:8; 6:12 LXX, where ἀνατολή translates the Hebrew צֶמַח \"Branch\"). \"Dawn\" captures the light imagery that continues in v. 79.\n\n**\"Public appearance\" (v. 80)**: Greek ἀναδείξεως refers to a formal presentation or commissioning for public service, not merely \"appearing\" in a casual sense."

      "notes": "**\"Guest quarters\" (v. 7)**: The Greek κατάλυμα does not mean \"inn\" (that would be πανδοχεῖον, which Luke uses in 10:34 for the Good Samaritan parable). It means a guest room or lodging space—the same word Luke uses for the \"upper room\" of the Last Supper (22:11). The image is of a crowded guest room in a family home, not a commercial establishment turning away customers.\n\n**\"Feeding trough\" (v. 7, 12, 16)**: φάτνη is literally a manger—a trough from which animals eat. \"Manger\" has become so sentimentalized in English that \"feeding trough\" better conveys the stark, humble reality.\n\n**\"People of his favor\" (v. 14)**: The genitive εὐδοκίας modifies \"people,\" not the clause as a whole. This is not \"good will toward men\" (KJV, following a variant reading) but \"peace among people who have [God's] favor\"—those upon whom God's choosing rests.\n\n**\"Messenger\" (v. 9, 10, 12, 13, 15)**: ἄγγελος literally means \"messenger.\" While \"angel\" is the traditional rendering, retaining \"messenger\" keeps the word's fundamental meaning visible and connects to the vocabulary of announcement.\n\n**\"The Lord's Anointed\" (v. 26)**: τὸν χριστὸν κυρίου is a Septuagintal phrase (cf. 1 Sam 24:6, 10; 26:9, etc.) meaning \"the Anointed of the Lord\"—the awaited messianic king. This preserves the connection to Israel's royal tradition better than simply \"the Christ.\"\n\n**\"Consolation of Israel\" (v. 25)**: παράκλησιν echoes Isaiah 40:1 (\"Comfort, comfort my people\") and its promises of restoration. Simeon is waiting for God to fulfill these prophetic hopes.\n\n**\"In the place of my Father\" (v. 49)**: ἐν τοῖς τοῦ πατρός μου is genuinely ambiguous—it could mean \"in my Father's house,\" \"about my Father's business,\" or \"among my Father's things/affairs.\" I chose \"in the place of my Father\" to preserve this productive ambiguity while gesturing at the temple context.\n\n**\"Maturity\" (v. 52)**: ἡλικία can mean either \"age\" or \"stature.\" Given the context of growth in wisdom and favor, \"maturity\" captures both physical and personal development better than either single option."

      "notes": "**\"The word of God came upon John\" (v. 2)**: The phrase ἐγένετο ῥῆμα θεοῦ ἐπὶ echoes the prophetic call narratives of the Hebrew scriptures (cf. Jeremiah 1:1; Hosea 1:1). Luke deliberately presents John's ministry using the vocabulary of prophetic commissioning.\n\n**\"Release of sins\" (v. 3)**: Greek ἄφεσις means release, letting go, remission. \"Forgiveness\" works, but \"release\" better captures the sense of liberation from bondage that ἄφεσις carries, particularly in light of the Isaiah quotation that follows with its themes of preparation and making straight.\n\n**\"Brood of vipers\" (v. 7)**: γεννήματα ἐχιδνῶν—literally \"offspring of vipers.\" \"Brood\" captures both the biological sense and the collective nature of the accusation.\n\n**\"Do not extort money by threats\" (v. 14)**: Greek διασείω literally means \"shake violently\"—a vivid image of the physical intimidation soldiers could use to extract money. \"Shake down\" is the closest English idiom but somewhat informal; I opted for a more explicit rendering.\n\n**\"Bring false accusations\" (v. 14)**: Greek συκοφαντέω referred to making malicious accusations to gain advantage—a particular temptation for soldiers who could bring charges against civilians.\n\n**\"In you I delight\" (v. 22)**: Greek εὐδόκησα is aorist, but likely functions as a timeless expression of divine pleasure. \"I delight\" captures this better than the more static \"I am well pleased\" and echoes the language of Isaiah 42:1.\n\n**\"When he began\" (v. 23)**: The Greek ἀρχόμενος (\"beginning\") likely refers to the beginning of Jesus's public ministry. The word stands somewhat awkwardly without an explicit object, but the meaning is clear from context.\n\n**The genealogy's conclusion (v. 38)**: Luke traces Jesus's lineage back through Adam to God (τοῦ θεοῦ), a distinctive feature absent from Matthew's genealogy. This emphasizes Jesus's connection to all humanity, not just Israel—consistent with Luke's universal emphasis."

Luke signals the devil's strategic withdrawal and anticipated return at Jesus's passion.\n\n**\"Nazara\" (v. 16)**: Preserving the form in the Greek text rather than standardizing to \"Nazareth.\"\n\n**\"In your hearing\" (v. 21)**: Literally \"in your ears\" (ἐν τοῖς ὠσὶν ὑμῶν). The idiom emphasizes that fulfillment occurs in the very act of their hearing Jesus read it.\n\n**\"What is there between us and you?\" (v. 34)**: τί ἡμῖν καὶ σοί is a Semitic idiom (cf. Hebrew מַה־לָּנוּ וָלָךְ) expressing protest or rejection of involvement. It could mean \"What have we to do with you?\" or \"Why are you interfering with us?\"\n\n**\"In the grip of\" (v. 38)**: συνεχομένη conveys being seized, constrained, or oppressed—stronger than merely \"suffering from.\"\n\n**\"Rebuked the fever\" (v. 39)**: Luke uses ἐπετίμησεν (the same verb used for demons in v. 35) for Jesus's treatment of the fever, suggesting Luke understood illness as having a quasi-personal, hostile character that Jesus confronted with authoritative command.\n\n**\"Judea\" (v. 44)**: The earliest manuscripts read \"Judea,\" though contextually Galilee seems expected. Following the critical text, understanding \"Judea\" here perhaps in the broader sense of \"Jewish territory\" or as Luke's anticipatory focus on Jerusalem."

      "notes": "**\"Master\" (v. 5)**: The Greek ἐπιστάτα is Luke's distinctive term (appearing only in his Gospel in the NT). It connotes authority and oversight—someone who is in charge. Other translations use \"Master,\" which I retain here as it captures the sense of recognized authority without the specifically rabbinic overtones of \"Rabbi.\"\n\n**\"Catching people alive\" (v. 10)**: The Greek ζωγρῶν literally means \"catching alive\"—the word combines ζωός (alive) with ἀγρέω (to catch). It was used for taking prisoners of war alive rather than killing them. This is more vivid than simply \"catching\" or \"fishing for\" people—it suggests capturing for life, not death.\n\n**\"Skin disease\" (v. 12)**: The Greek λέπρα in the first century encompassed various skin conditions, not just what modern medicine calls Hansen's disease. The man is described as πλήρης λέπρας (full of/covered with the disease), indicating an advanced case that would have made him severely ritually unclean.\n\n**\"Friend\" (v. 20)**: The Greek Ἄνθρωπε is literally \"Man\" as a form of address. While some translations render this as \"Man\" or leave it formal, \"Friend\" better captures the tone of compassionate directness that Jesus uses here, especially given the context of Jesus seeing the faith of those who brought him.\n\n**\"Extraordinary things\" (v. 26)**: The Greek παράδοξα means things contrary to expectation (παρά + δόξα)—literally, \"things beyond opinion/belief.\" This captures the paradoxical, expectation-shattering nature of what they witnessed better than simply \"strange things\" or \"remarkable things.\"\n\n**\"Grumbling\" (v. 30)**: The Greek ἐγόγγυζον echoes the Septuagint's description of Israel grumbling against Moses in the wilderness. This word choice may be intentional, casting the Pharisees in the role of the complaining Israelites.\n\n**\"Wedding guests\" (v. 34)**: Literally \"sons of the bridal chamber\" (υἱοὺς τοῦ νυμφῶνος), a Semitic idiom for those invited to participate in the wedding celebration. The phrase carries connotations of intimate participation in the joy of the occasion.\n\n**\"Aged wine is better\" (v. 39)**: The Greek χρηστός means \"good, pleasant, excellent\"—it was a standard term for wine quality. This verse (absent from some manuscripts but present in the SBLGNT) presents the perspective of those accustomed to old ways, who naturally prefer what they know."

The rich have already received their receipt; the transaction is closed. \"In full\" makes explicit what the Greek commercial idiom implies.\n\n**\"Credit\" (vv. 32-34)**: The Greek χάρις here does not mean \"grace\" in its theological sense but rather \"credit\" or \"what is praiseworthy\"—what puts you in a favorable position. The rhetorical question asks: what is noteworthy or commendable about such love?\n\n**\"Release\" (v. 37)**: The Greek ἀπολύετε can mean \"forgive\" but more literally means \"release, let go, set free\"—the same word used for releasing prisoners. Using \"release\" preserves this concrete imagery and the reciprocal logic: release others and you will be released.\n\n**\"Into your lap\" (v. 38)**: The Greek κόλπος refers to the fold of a garment at the chest, used as a pocket or pouch for carrying goods. The image is of grain being measured out so generously that it overflows into the folds of one's clothing.\n\n**\"Pretender\" (v. 42)**: The Greek ὑποκριτά originally meant \"actor\" or \"one who plays a part.\" The modern English \"hypocrite\" has shifted to mean someone who believes one thing and does another, but Jesus's critique is about performing a role—pretending to see clearly while actually blind. \"Pretender\" recovers some of this theatrical sense.\n\n**\"Treasury of the heart\" (v. 45)**: The Greek θησαυρός means \"storehouse\" or \"treasury\"—a place where valuable things are kept. The image is of the heart as a storehouse from which one draws what has been accumulated there.\n\n**\"Overflow\" (v. 45)**: The Greek περίσσευμα means \"abundance\" or \"surplus\"—what spills over because there is more than can be contained. Speech reveals what the heart is full of."

This is a visceral, gut-level compassion—not mere pity but deep physical empathy.\n\n**\"Gave him to his mother\" (v. 15)**: This phrase deliberately echoes 1 Kings 17:23 (LXX), where Elijah raises the widow of Zarephath's son and \"gave him to his mother.\" Luke signals that Jesus is acting in the prophetic tradition—which the crowd immediately recognizes in v. 16.\n\n**\"The Coming One\" (v. 19, 20)**: ὁ ἐρχόμενος was a recognized messianic title, referring to the expected deliverer. The definite article marks this as a specific figure.\n\n**\"Granted sight\" (v. 21)**: The verb ἐχαρίσατο means \"graciously gave as a gift\"—emphasizing the healing as pure grace, not earned.\n\n**\"Acknowledged God's righteousness\" (v. 29)**: Greek ἐδικαίωσαν τὸν θεόν—literally \"justified God\"—means they declared God to be in the right, vindicating his purposes through their response to John's baptism.\n\n**\"Rejected God's purpose for themselves\" (v. 30)**: The phrase εἰς ἑαυτούς (\"for/against themselves\") indicates that their rejection of God's counsel harmed themselves.\n\n**\"Kept kissing\" (v. 38, 45)**: The verb κατεφίλει uses an intensive prefix and imperfect tense, indicating continuous, fervent action—not a single kiss but repeated kissing.\n\n**\"As her great love shows\" (v. 47)**: The Greek ὅτι here is notoriously difficult. The parable clearly teaches that forgiveness produces love (not that love earns forgiveness). The ὅτι clause best reads as evidential: her great love demonstrates that she has been forgiven much, not that her love caused the forgiveness. This translation makes this logic explicit.\n\n**\"Go in peace\" (v. 50)**: Greek εἰς εἰρήνην (literally \"into peace\") reflects the Hebrew לְשָׁלוֹם—a blessing formula meaning to enter into a state of wholeness and wellbeing."

      "notes": "**\"Providing for them\" (v. 3)**: The Greek διηκόνουν means serving or ministering, and with ἐκ τῶν ὑπαρχόντων αὐταῖς (\"out of their possessions\") indicates these women were financially supporting Jesus's ministry—a significant detail Luke preserves about the material backing of the itinerant movement.\n\n**\"Tassel\" (v. 44)**: The Greek κράσπεδον refers to the fringes (Hebrew: tzitzit) commanded in Numbers 15:38-39 and Deuteronomy 22:12. These tassels were worn as reminders of the commandments. The woman's touch is thus religiously significant—she reaches for a sacred element of his garment.\n\n**\"Noble and good heart\" (v. 15)**: The phrase καρδίᾳ καλῇ καὶ ἀγαθῇ uses two Greek adjectives for good. The combination καλὸς κἀγαθός was a well-known Greek ideal of nobility and goodness. Luke may be deliberately using language resonant with Hellenistic moral vocabulary.\n\n**\"Bring fruit to maturity\" (v. 14)**: The Greek τελεσφοροῦσιν (a hapax in the NT) specifically means to bring to completion or full development—stronger than simply \"bear fruit.\" The word emphasizes the failure to reach full fruition.\n\n**\"In a season of testing\" (v. 13)**: The word πειρασμός can mean temptation or testing/trial. \"Testing\" captures the broader semantic range—these are people whose faith does not survive difficult circumstances.\n\n**\"Abyss\" (v. 31)**: The ἄβυσσος refers to the primordial deep and, in apocalyptic literature, the place where evil spirits are imprisoned (cf. Revelation 9:1, 20:1-3). The demons fear being sent to this place of confinement before the appointed time.\n\n**\"In his right mind\" (v. 35)**: The Greek σωφρονοῦντα indicates sound-mindedness, self-control, rationality—the opposite of the chaotic, driven existence described earlier.\n\n**\"Saved\" (vv. 36, 48, 50)**: The verb σῴζω means both to heal/make well and to save in the theological sense. Luke uses it throughout this chapter with layered meaning—physical restoration and spiritual deliverance interweave.\n\n**\"Master\" (vv. 24, 45)**: The Greek Ἐπιστάτα is Luke's preferred term of address (used only in Luke in the NT), meaning something like \"commander\" or \"chief\"—a term of authority and respect."

      "notes": "**\"Exodus\" (v. 31)**: The Greek ἔξοδον deliberately evokes Israel's departure from Egypt. Luke's choice is theologically loaded—Jesus's death in Jerusalem is being framed as a new exodus, a liberation. \"Departure\" (common in translations) loses this resonance entirely.\n\n**\"The Chosen One\" (v. 35)**: Luke uniquely has ὁ ἐκλελεγμένος where Matthew and Mark have \"beloved.\" This echoes Isaiah 42:1 (the Servant Song) and presents Jesus specifically as God's elect one. The SBLGNT follows this reading.\n\n**\"Let these words sink into your ears\" (v. 44)**: The Greek Θέσθε...εἰς τὰ ὦτα ὑμῶν is a Semitic idiom meaning \"listen carefully and remember.\" A literal \"put into your ears\" sounds odd in English; \"sink into\" captures the sense of penetration and retention.\n\n**\"Twisted\" (v. 41)**: διεστραμμένη echoes Deuteronomy 32:5 (LXX), where Moses calls Israel a \"crooked and twisted generation.\" Jesus's lament deliberately recalls Moses's frustration with Israel. \"Perverse\" is accurate but has acquired narrower connotations in modern English.\n\n**\"Set his face\" (v. 51, 53)**: τὸ πρόσωπον ἐστήρισεν is a Semitic idiom expressing firm resolve (cf. Isaiah 50:7, Ezekiel 21:2). The language appears twice, emphasizing Jesus's determined orientation toward Jerusalem and his fate there.\n\n**\"Being taken up\" (v. 51)**: ἀναλήμψεως refers to Jesus's ascension, but Luke places it here proleptically—the entire journey to Jerusalem is framed by its ultimate endpoint. The term encompasses his death, resurrection, and ascension as one movement.\n\n**\"Master\" (v. 33, 49)**: Ἐπιστάτα is Luke's distinctive term for Jesus (used only in Luke), meaning something like \"commander\" or \"overseer.\" It's how the disciples address Jesus and carries more authority than simply \"teacher.\"\n\n**\"Crush\" (v. 39)**: συντρῖβον describes the spirit's effect—literally \"shattering\" or \"crushing\" the boy. This conveys the violence and destruction more forcefully than softer alternatives like \"injure.\""

Ancient Near Eastern greetings involved extended formalities; the mission allows no delay.\n\n**\"I was watching\" (v. 18)**: The imperfect ἐθεώρουν suggests ongoing vision—\"I was beholding\"—not a single past event. The timing is debated: cosmic prehistory, during the mission, or prophetic certainty of what their work inaugurates.\n\n**\"Exulted\" (v. 21)**: ἠγαλλιάσατο is stronger than \"rejoiced\"—it's intense, expressive joy.\n\n**\"Infants\" (v. 21)**: νηπίοις literally means infants/small children. The contrast with \"wise and learned\" (σοφῶν καὶ συνετῶν) is deliberately stark—divine revelation comes to the unsophisticated.\n\n**\"Fell among bandits\" (v. 30)**: λῃσταί are violent robbers or bandits, not petty thieves (κλέπται).

      "notes": "**\"Bread for the coming day\" (v. 3)**: The word ἐπιούσιον appears almost nowhere else in Greek literature and its meaning is debated. Options include \"daily,\" \"necessary for existence,\" or \"for the coming day.\" Given the phrase τὸ καθ' ἡμέραν (\"each day\") that follows in Luke, I've rendered it to emphasize provision for each day's need rather than stockpiling—consistent with the manna tradition where Israel gathered only what was needed for each day.\n\n**\"Time of testing\" (v. 4)**: The Greek πειρασμόν means \"test\" or \"trial\" more than \"temptation\" in the modern sense of enticement to sin. The petition asks God not to bring us into a situation of severe testing or trial.\n\n**\"Shameless persistence\" (v. 8)**: The word ἀναίδεια literally means \"shamelessness.\" In an honor-shame culture, this could refer either to the asker's bold persistence or to the sleeper's desire to avoid the shame of refusing. I've followed the traditional reading (the asker's persistence), though the alternative interpretation has scholarly support.\n\n**\"Keep asking... keep seeking... keep knocking\" (v. 9)**: The Greek verbs are present imperatives, indicating continuous or repeated action, not one-time requests.\n\n**\"Finger of God\" (v. 20)**: This phrase echoes Exodus 8:19, where Pharaoh's magicians acknowledge God's power in the plagues. Where Matthew has \"Spirit of God,\" Luke preserves this Exodus allusion.\n\n**\"Has arrived\" (v. 20)**: The verb ἔφθασεν indicates actual arrival, not merely approach. The kingdom has genuinely come upon them in Jesus's exorcisms.\n\n**\"Sound... diseased\" (v. 34)**: The Greek ἁπλοῦς can mean \"simple,\" \"single,\" \"healthy,\" or \"generous\" (a \"good eye\" in Semitic idiom meant generosity). Similarly, πονηρός can mean \"evil\" or refer to a diseased/bad eye. In this light/darkness context, I've used \"sound\" and \"diseased\" to capture both the physical and moral dimensions.\n\n**\"Ritual washing\" (v. 38)**: The verb ἐβαπτίσθη here refers to Jewish ritual immersion or washing before meals, not Christian baptism.\n\n**\"Give what is within as charity\" (v. 41)**: This verse is notoriously difficult. The Greek τὰ ἐνόντα (\"the things inside\") may mean \"give from the heart\" or \"give what you have\" as alms—the point being that inner transformation, expressed in generosity, is what truly cleanses.\n\n**\"Legal experts\" (vv. 45-52)**: The νομικοί were experts in the Mosaic law, a category overlapping with but distinct from the scribes and Pharisees. \"Lawyers\" is the traditional rendering but suggests modern attorneys; \"legal experts\" clarifies their specialty in Torah interpretation.\n\n**\"The Wisdom of God said\" (v. 49)**: This introduces a quotation whose source is unknown—possibly personified Wisdom speaking, or a reference to a lost text, or Jesus speaking as divine Wisdom."

      "notes": "**\"Play-acting\" (v. 1) / \"Performers\" (v. 56)**: The Greek ὑπόκρισις and ὑποκριταί derive from theatrical vocabulary—stage acting and actors playing roles. The Pharisees' problem is not that they believe one thing and do another (the modern sense of \"hypocrite\"), but that their piety is performance. \"Play-acting\" and \"performers\" recover this original meaning.\n\n**\"Innermost rooms\" (v. 3)**: Greek ταμεῖον refers to the most private domestic space—a storeroom or inner chamber, not simply any \"room.\" The contrast is between maximum privacy and maximum publicity (rooftops were public gathering places).\n\n**\"Gehenna\" (v. 5)**: I retained the transliteration rather than using \"hell,\" which carries too much later theological baggage. Gehenna (גֵּי הִנֹּם, Valley of Hinnom) was a specific place associated with divine judgment.\n\n**\"Two small coins\" (v. 6)**: Greek ἀσσαρίων δύο—two assaria, Roman copper coins worth about 1/16 of a denarius each. \"Small coins\" conveys the insignificant monetary value without the distraction of unfamiliar currency terms.\n\n**\"Lifespan\" (v. 25)**: Greek ἡλικία can mean either physical stature or lifespan. The context of verse 26 (\"this smallest thing\") suggests lifespan—a πῆχυς (cubit, about 18 inches) would not be a \"small\" addition to one's height, but metaphorically it makes sense as a minimal addition to life's duration.\n\n**\"Being demanded\" (v. 20)**: The Greek ἀπαιτοῦσιν is third person plural (\"they are demanding\"), possibly a circumlocution for divine action or referring to angelic beings who collect souls. The passive construction preserves this ambiguity.\n\n**\"Cut him in pieces\" (v. 46)**: Greek διχοτομήσει literally means \"to cut in two.\" This is shockingly severe language; some argue it's hyperbolic or metaphorical, but I've translated it directly.\n\n**\"Unsettled\" (v. 29)**: Greek μετεωρίζεσθε means to be raised up or suspended, hence agitated or anxious—hanging in worried suspense. \"Unsettled\" captures this better than a simple repetition of \"worry.\"\n\n**\"Girded waists\" (v. 35)**: This imagery alludes to Exodus 12:11, where Israelites ate the Passover with loins girded, ready for immediate departure. First-century readers would catch this Passover resonance.\n\n**\"This present time\" (v. 56)**: Greek καιρός often means a decisive or opportune moment, not merely chronological time (χρόνος). Jesus is speaking about the critical nature of the current era, not just the season."

In Jewish thought, sin creates a debt to God. \"Guilty\" captures this moral sense in English without requiring explanation of the debt metaphor.\n\n**\"Wasting the soil\" (v. 7)**: καταργεῖ means to render ineffective or useless. The fig tree is not just taking up space but actively depleting resources that could benefit productive plants.\n\n**\"Pretenders\" (v. 15)**: The Greek ὑποκριταί derives from theatrical performance—those who play a role on stage. \"Hypocrites\" in modern English has narrowed to mean believing one thing and doing another. Jesus's point is sharper: these are people performing religiosity while missing its heart. \"Pretenders\" captures the theatrical sense while remaining natural.\n\n**\"Untied... bondage\" (v. 16)**: The Greek λυθῆναι (to be untied) and δεσμοῦ (bondage) deliberately echo the λύει (untie) of verse 15. Jesus creates a wordplay: you untie animals on the Sabbath, but object to this woman being untied from Satan's bondage? The translation preserves this connection.\n\n**\"Struggle\" (v. 24)**: Ἀγωνίζεσθε is agonistic language—from the arena and athletic competition. It implies intense exertion and combat, not merely polite effort. \"Struggle\" captures this intensity better than \"strive.\"\n\n**\"Recline at the banquet\" (v. 29)**: ἀνακλιθήσονται means to recline at a meal, the posture for formal banqueting. The kingdom imagery here is of a great feast; \"recline\" preserves this cultural detail.\n\n**\"I reach my goal\" (v. 32)**: τελειοῦμαι can mean \"I am completed/perfected/finished.\" There is deliberate ambiguity—Jesus speaks of completing his work but also hints at his death (reaching his τέλος, his end/purpose). \"I reach my goal\" preserves this ambiguity better than \"I am perfected\" or \"I finish.\"\n\n**\"Your house is abandoned to you\" (v. 35)**: ἀφίεται means \"is left\" or \"abandoned.\" \"House\" (οἶκος) likely refers to the Temple, though it can also mean household or dynasty. The passive voice is ominous—left by whom? The implication is divine abandonment."

The term \"dropsy\" is retained as it accurately names this condition in period medical terminology.\n\n**\"Legal experts\" (v. 3)**: νομικούς refers specifically to those professionally trained in Torah interpretation, distinct from Pharisees as a religious-political movement.\n\n**\"Places of honor\" (v. 7)**: πρωτοκλισίας literally means \"first reclining places\"—at formal meals, guests reclined on couches, with positions near the host indicating status.\n\n**\"Destitute\" (vv. 13, 21)**: πτωχός denotes complete poverty (beggars, those with nothing), distinct from πένης (working poor). \"Poor\" flattens this distinction.\n\n**\"That would be your repayment\" (v. 12)**: ἀνταπόδομα suggests a transaction completed—the reciprocal invitation would close the account, leaving no room for divine reward.\n\n**\"One and all\" (v. 18)**: ἀπὸ μιᾶς is an idiomatic expression meaning \"unanimously\" or \"with one accord\"—they all immediately and together began making excuses.\n\n**\"Hate\" (v. 26)**: μισεῖ in Semitic idiom expresses comparative preference rather than emotional hatred (cf. Gen 29:31 LXX where Leah being \"hated\" means loved less than Rachel; Mal 1:2-3). However, retaining \"hate\" preserves the shocking rhetorical force Jesus intended; softening to \"love less\" would domesticate demanding language.\n\n**\"Loses its saltiness\" (v. 34)**: μωρανθῇ literally means \"become foolish\" (same root as English \"moron\"), but applied to salt it means losing its essential quality. The wordplay between moral foolishness and salt becoming useless may be intentional.\n\n**\"Manure pile\" (v. 35)**: κοπρία refers to dung heaps. Salt was mixed with manure to catalyze decomposition for fertilizer; salt that had lost its properties was useless even for this purpose."

This is the same verb used of Israel's grumbling in the wilderness (LXX), creating an implicit comparison.\n\n**\"Was moved in his gut\" (v. 20)**: The Greek ἐσπλαγχνίσθη derives from σπλάγχνα (intestines/bowels), the seat of deep emotion in ancient physiology. \"Moved with compassion\" is accurate but loses the visceral, bodily nature of the response. This is a profoundly physical reaction.\n\n**\"Kissed him again and again\" (v. 20)**: The Greek κατεφίλησεν uses the κατα- prefix as an intensifier, and the verb itself already conveys affection. This is emphatic, repeated, or fervent kissing—not a single formal kiss.\n\n**\"Living dissolutely\" (v. 13)**: The adverb ἀσώτως comes from ἄσωτος (literally \"unsavable\"), describing reckless, wasteful living. \"Prodigal\" has become so associated with this parable that it has lost descriptive force. \"Dissolutely\" captures the moral dimension of wastefulness.\n\n**\"Attached himself\" (v. 15)**: The Greek ἐκολλήθη means literally \"glued himself to\"—language of desperate clinging. The Jewish son reducing himself to tending pigs (unclean animals) for a Gentile would have been shocking to the original audience.\n\n**\"Coming to himself\" (v. 17)**: The idiom εἰς ἑαυτὸν ἐλθών means \"coming to one's senses.\" This phrase marks the turning point—a moment of self-awareness and recognition.\n\n**\"Slaving for you\" (v. 29)**: The elder son uses δουλεύω (to serve as a slave), revealing his perception of his relationship with his father—servitude rather than sonship. This is thematically crucial: he has been in the father's house all along but has understood himself as a slave, not a son.\n\n**\"This son of yours\" / \"this brother of yours\" (vv. 30, 32)**: The elder son refuses to say \"my brother,\" using the distancing phrase \"this son of yours.\" The father gently corrects him: \"this brother of yours\"—insisting on the relationship.\n\n**\"We had to\" (v. 32)**: The Greek ἔδει expresses necessity—\"it was necessary.\" The celebration was not optional but morally imperative given what had occurred."

      "notes": "**\"Estate manager\" / \"manager\" (v. 1-8)**: Greek οἰκονόμος refers to a trusted servant who managed a household or estate's affairs—finances, property, and personnel. \"Steward\" is archaic; \"manager\" captures the role while \"estate manager\" specifies the context.\n\n**\"Contract\" (v. 6, 7)**: Greek τὰ γράμματα literally means \"the writings\" but here refers specifically to the debt document or promissory note. \"Contract\" conveys the legal-commercial nature better than the vague \"bill.\"\n\n**\"Baths\" and \"cors\" (v. 6, 7)**: These are Hebrew/Aramaic measures transliterated into Greek (βάτος, κόρος). A bath was approximately 8-9 gallons; a cor was roughly 10-12 bushels. The oil debt reduction (50%) and wheat reduction (20%) likely represent the manager forgiving his own commission, making his action shrewd but possibly not strictly theft.\n\n**\"Dishonest wealth\" (v. 9, 11)**: Greek μαμωνᾶ τῆς ἀδικίας is literally \"mammon of unrighteousness.\" μαμωνᾶς is an Aramaic loanword for wealth/property. The genitive \"of unrighteousness\" characterizes wealth as inherently tainted by this world's corrupt systems, not that it was necessarily acquired dishonestly.\n\n**\"Children of this age... children of light\" (v. 8)**: The phrase υἱοὶ τοῦ αἰῶνος τούτου and υἱοὺς τοῦ φωτός uses the Semitic idiom \"sons of X\" meaning \"those who belong to/are characterized by X.\" This terminology appears also in the Dead Sea Scrolls.\n\n**\"Sneering\" (v. 14)**: Greek ἐξεμυκτήριζον derives from μυκτήρ (nose)—literally \"turning up the nose.\" This captures contemptuous mockery more vividly than \"scoffed\" or \"ridiculed.\"\n\n**\"Abomination\" (v. 15)**: Greek βδέλυγμα is a strong term used in the LXX especially for idolatry and things detestable to God. The point is that what humans value highly (social status, wealth) God regards as he regards idols.\n\n**\"Pressing forcefully into it\" (v. 16)**: Greek βιάζεται (middle voice) has been debated—does it mean people are forcing their way in (positive urgency) or the kingdom is being attacked? The middle voice and context suggest eager, forceful entry.\n\n**\"Abraham's side\" (v. 22, 23)**: Greek κόλπος literally means \"bosom\" or \"chest\" but idiomatically refers to the place of honor at a banquet, reclining next to the host. This evokes the eschatological banquet imagery—Lazarus now holds the position of honor beside Abraham.\n\n**\"Hades\" (v. 23)**: I retain \"Hades\" (ᾅδης) rather than \"hell\" because first-century Jewish hearers would understand this as the realm of the dead, not the later Christian concept of eternal punishment. The narrative draws on Jewish traditions about the afterlife's geography.\n\n**\"Rises from the dead\" (v. 31)**: Greek ἀναστῇ (from ἀνίστημι) specifically means \"rise/stand up\"—the standard resurrection vocabulary. For Luke's audience, this final line would carry profound irony given Jesus's own resurrection and the continued unbelief it encountered."

      "notes": "**\"Slaves who have earned nothing extra\" (v. 10)**: The Greek ἀχρεῖοι is often translated \"worthless\" or \"unworthy,\" which can sound like self-denigration. The term more precisely means \"without profit\" or \"having produced no surplus value\"—slaves who have done only what was required and thus merit no special reward. The point is not that disciples are worthless, but that obedience is baseline expectation, not grounds for commendation.\n\n**\"If you had faith\" (v. 6)**: The Greek construction (εἰ + imperfect... ἂν + imperfect/aorist) is a contrary-to-fact conditional, implying \"but you don't.\" Most translations render this as present tense (\"if you have\"), which loses the implicit critique.\n\n**\"In your midst\" (v. 21)**: The Greek ἐντὸς ὑμῶν could mean \"within you\" (interior/spiritual) or \"among you\" (present in your midst). Given that Jesus is speaking to Pharisees, \"within you\" seems theologically unlikely. \"Among you\" suggests the kingdom is already present in Jesus himself.\n\n**\"Vultures\" (v. 37)**: The Greek ἀετοί technically means \"eagles,\" but eagles are not carrion birds. The reference to gathering around a σῶμα (corpse) indicates scavenging behavior, pointing to vultures—which ancient writers sometimes grouped with eagles.\n\n**\"Corpse\" (v. 37)**: The Greek σῶμα means \"body\" but in context clearly refers to a dead body. Making this explicit captures the grim proverbial nature of the saying.\n\n**\"Master\" (v. 13)**: The Greek ἐπιστάτα is unique to Luke and means \"overseer, commander, chief\"—a term of authority stronger than \"teacher.\"\n\n**Verse 36 omitted**: This verse, present in some manuscripts and traditional translations, is absent from the earliest and best manuscripts and represents an interpolation from Matthew 24:40."

      "notes": "**\"Wear me down completely\" (v. 5)**: The Greek ὑπωπιάζῃ literally means \"give me a black eye\" or \"strike me under the eye.\" It's vivid, almost comic language for being worn out by someone's persistence. The phrase εἰς τέλος can mean \"finally\" or \"completely\"—the judge fears being utterly exhausted by her relentless coming.\n\n**\"Is he slow to act on their behalf?\" (v. 7)**: The phrase καὶ μακροθυμεῖ ἐπ' αὐτοῖς is notoriously difficult. μακροθυμέω typically means \"be patient,\" but its function here is debated. I've rendered it as a rhetorical question expecting a negative answer, paralleling the structure of the preceding question—God will not delay.\n\n**\"Such faith\" (v. 8)**: The article τὴν πίστιν may indicate \"faith of this kind\"—the persistent, crying-out faith exemplified in the parable.\n\n**\"Prayed these things concerning himself\" (v. 11)**: The phrase πρὸς ἑαυτὸν ταῦτα is ambiguous—it could mean \"by himself\" (location) or \"to/about himself\" (the content and direction of his prayer). The latter captures the irony: his thanksgiving is really about himself, not God.\n\n**\"The sinner\" (v. 13)**: The article τῷ ἁμαρτωλῷ is emphatic—not just \"a sinner\" but \"the sinner,\" as if he were the only one or the chief one. It expresses profound self-awareness.\n\n**\"Show mercy\" (v. 13)**: The verb ἱλάσθητι carries sacrificial overtones from LXX usage—propitiation, atonement. The tax collector appeals to God's merciful nature to cover his sin.\n\n**\"Swindlers, cheaters\" (v. 11)**: ἅρπαγες (those who seize, plunder) and ἄδικοι (unrighteous, unjust) are rendered to capture the specific accusations—not just generic sinfulness but economic predation and unfair dealing.\n\n**\"Since my youth\" (v. 21)**: ἐκ νεότητος refers to the age of religious responsibility (around 13), when a Jewish male became obligated to keep the commandments.\n\n**\"Your faith has saved you\" (v. 42)**: σέσωκέν encompasses both physical healing and spiritual salvation—the ambiguity is intentional in Greek and should be preserved."

      "notes": "**\"Chief tax collector\" (v. 2)**: ἀρχιτελώνης is a hapax legomenon—this is its only occurrence in ancient Greek literature. The prefix ἀρχι- indicates a supervisor or chief. This was likely someone who contracted with Rome for tax collection rights and employed other tax collectors under him, making him both wealthy and doubly despised.\n\n**\"Extorted\" (v. 8)**: ἐσυκοφάντησα means to make false accusations for gain or to extort through intimidation—a specific form of corruption associated with tax collectors who could threaten people with inflated assessments. \"Cheated\" or \"defrauded\" are too generic.\n\n**\"Four times as much\" (v. 8)**: This exceeds the standard Torah requirement for restitution (principal plus 20%, per Leviticus 6:5), matching instead the penalty for theft of livestock (Exodus 22:1). Zacchaeus offers the maximum possible restitution.\n\n**\"Minas\" (v. 13ff)**: A mina was worth about 100 drachmas—roughly 100 days' wages for a laborer. This is far less than the talents in Matthew 25's similar parable, making the story more about faithfulness in ordinary matters than about vast wealth.\n\n**\"Do business with this\" (v. 13)**: Πραγματεύσασθε is commercial language—\"trade\" or \"conduct business.\" The master expects profit, not mere preservation.\n\n**\"Harsh\" (v. 21-22)**: αὐστηρός means severe, exacting, strict—someone difficult to please. \"Harsh\" captures the servant's perception of the master as unreasonably demanding.\n\n**\"The bank\" (v. 23)**: τράπεζαν literally means \"table\"—specifically a money-changer's table. This was the ancient equivalent of depositing money at interest.\n\n**\"Slaughter\" (v. 27)**: κατασφάξατε is a violent word—to cut down, butcher, slay. The parable's ending is deliberately shocking.\n\n**\"If you had known... the things that make for peace!\" (v. 42)**: The sentence breaks off unfinished (aposiopesis), a rhetorical device expressing overwhelming emotion. Jesus cannot bring himself to complete the thought of what might have been.\n\n**\"The time of your visitation\" (v. 44)**: ἐπισκοπή means a divine visit—God coming to inspect, help, or judge. The term carries the weight of God's presence coming to his people, whether for salvation or judgment. Jerusalem failed to recognize that this moment of divine visitation had arrived.\n\n**\"Den of bandits\" (v. 46)**: λῃστῶν refers to bandits or robbers (not petty thieves), echoing Jeremiah 7:11 LXX. The image is of criminals using a hideout—the temple has become a place where exploitation is sheltered rather than confronted.\n\n**\"Hung on his every word\" (v. 48)**: ἐξεκρέματο is vivid—literally \"hung from him.\" The people were so captivated they were suspended on his words, making it impossible for the authorities to act."

This is stronger than \"all she had to live on\"; it was her entire economic existence.\n\n**\"Sacred offerings\" (v. 5)**: The Greek ἀναθήμασιν refers to votive offerings—gifts dedicated to the deity. \"Sacred offerings\" captures both the religious and material dimensions.\n\n**\"Upheavals\" (v. 9)**: The Greek ἀκαταστασίας denotes disorder, instability, tumult—civil unrest rather than merely \"revolutions\" or \"insurrections.\"\n\n**\"Rehearse\" (v. 14)**: The Greek προμελετᾶν means to practice or prepare beforehand, as one would rehearse a speech. This captures the sense better than simply \"prepare.\"\n\n**\"Words\" (v. 15)**: Literally \"mouth\" (στόμα), but the meaning is the words or speech that proceed from the mouth. \"Words and wisdom\" forms a natural pair.\n\n**\"Liberation\" (v. 28)**: The Greek ἀπολύτρωσις carries connotations of release, deliverance, ransom. While \"redemption\" is traditional, \"liberation\" emphasizes the concrete rescue being described.\n\n**\"Carousing\" (v. 34)**: The Greek κραιπάλῃ specifically refers to the aftereffects of excessive drinking—a hangover or the dissipation that follows a drinking bout. Paired with \"drunkenness,\" it paints a picture of excess.\n\n**\"Times of the nations\" (v. 24)**: This phrase καιροὶ ἐθνῶν is distinctive to Luke and suggests a period during which Gentile dominion over Jerusalem will continue until its appointed completion."

      "notes": "**\"With deep longing I have longed\" (v. 15)**: The Greek ἐπιθυμίᾳ ἐπεθύμησα is a cognate dative construction (a Hebraism), where the noun intensifies the verb. Renderings like \"I have earnestly desired\" capture the meaning but lose the emphatic doubling. \"With deep longing I have longed\" preserves both.\n\n**\"Benefactors\" (v. 25)**: εὐεργέται was a formal honorific title claimed by Hellenistic kings and Roman emperors. Jesus is making a pointed political critique—those who dominate call themselves \"Benefactors\" while doing the opposite of serving.\n\n**\"I covenant to you\" (v. 29)**: διατίθεμαι is the verb cognate to διαθήκη (covenant). Jesus uses covenantal language—he is establishing a covenant relationship with his disciples, parallel to the Father's covenant with him. \"Assign\" or \"grant\" (common translations) loses this covenantal resonance.\n\n**\"Satan has demanded to sift all of you\" (v. 31)**: ὑμᾶς is plural—Satan's demand encompasses all the disciples. But in v. 32, σοῦ is singular—Jesus prayed specifically for Peter. This shift matters theologically: all face testing, but Peter receives particular intercession for his particular role.\n\n**\"Insurrectionist\" (v. 52)**: λῃστής does not mean \"thief\" or \"robber\" in the sense of a petty criminal. It denotes a bandit, brigand, or violent revolutionary—Josephus uses this term for anti-Roman insurgents. Jesus is highlighting the absurdity of their armed approach.\n\n**\"The dominion of darkness\" (v. 53)**: ἐξουσία τοῦ σκότους could be \"authority\" or \"power,\" but \"dominion\" captures both the territorial and ruling sense—darkness has a realm and exercises authority within it during this hour.\n\n**Verses 43-44**: These verses are textually disputed (absent from some important manuscripts, present in others). The SBLGNT includes them with brackets. I have included them, as Luke's unique emphasis on Jesus's physical agony coheres with his overall narrative interests.\n\n**\"You say that I am\" (v. 70)**: ὑμεῖς λέγετε ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι is deliberately ambiguous—neither a direct affirmation nor a denial. This idiomatic response places the claim in their mouths while not repudiating it. The council clearly understands it as confirmation (v. 71)."

This was likely meant as mockery of royal pretensions, though the exact color is not specified.\n\n**\"Flogged\" (vv. 16, 22)**: παιδεύσας literally means \"discipline\" or \"chastise,\" but in this Roman judicial context it refers to the punishment of scourging—a severe beating short of execution.\n\n**Verse 17 omitted**: Following the critical text, verse 17 (about Pilate's custom of releasing a prisoner) is not included, as it is absent from the earliest manuscripts.\n\n**\"Sneered\" (v. 35)**: ἐξεμυκτήριζον literally means \"to turn up the nose at\"—a visceral expression of contempt stronger than mere mocking.\n\n**\"The Anointed One\" (vv. 35, 39)**: χριστός is rendered as \"Anointed One\" rather than \"Christ\" to recover the meaning a first-century reader would hear: a reference to the promised anointed king of Israel.\n\n**\"Reviling\" (v. 39)**: ἐβλασφήμει is stronger than mere mockery—it carries connotations of insulting speech that violates what is sacred.\n\n**\"The sun's light having failed\" (v. 45)**: τοῦ ἡλίου ἐκλιπόντος uses the verb from which we get \"eclipse,\" though Luke's readers would know a natural eclipse is impossible during Passover (full moon). The phrase emphasizes the supernatural character of the darkness.\n\n**\"Righteous\" (v. 47)**: δίκαιος can mean both \"innocent\" and \"righteous.\" Luke's centurion uses this distinctively Jewish-sounding term (contrast Mark's \"Son of God\"), fitting Luke's emphasis on Jesus's innocence and moral character.\n\n**\"The Sabbath was about to begin\" (v. 54)**: ἐπέφωσκεν literally means \"was dawning,\" but since the Jewish day begins at sunset, this refers to the Sabbath's approach at Friday evening—the light of Sabbath lamps about to be kindled."

      "notes": "**\"At the deep of dawn\" (v. 1)**: The Greek ὄρθρου βαθέως is an unusual phrase—literally \"deep dawn\"—suggesting the very earliest moments of twilight before sunrise, when darkness still prevailed. Most translations smooth this to \"very early\" or \"at early dawn,\" but the Greek emphasizes depth/profundity.\n\n**\"The living one\" (v. 5)**: τὸν ζῶντα is a substantive participle with the article, functioning almost as a title—\"the Living One\"—contrasted with \"the dead.\" This is more than \"him who lives\"; it suggests a category distinction.\n\n**\"Delirious nonsense\" (v. 11)**: The Greek λῆρος was used in medical contexts for the babbling of the sick or feverish. \"Idle talk\" or \"nonsense\" captures the dismissiveness but loses the implication that the women's report sounded like fevered raving.\n\n**\"Their eyes were held back\" (v. 16)**: ἐκρατοῦντο is a divine passive—their eyes were being restrained (by God) from recognizing him. This isn't natural failure to recognize but supernatural concealment.\n\n**\"Tossing back and forth\" (v. 17)**: ἀντιβάλλετε suggests an exchange, like throwing something back and forth—capturing the animated nature of their discussion.\n\n**\"Slow of heart\" (v. 25)**: βραδεῖς τῇ καρδίᾳ—the heart in Hebrew/Jewish understanding is the seat of will and understanding, not merely emotion. Jesus is rebuking their sluggish comprehension, not their emotional responsiveness.\n\n**\"Disbelieving from joy\" (v. 41)**: ἀπιστούντων... ἀπὸ τῆς χαρᾶς captures the psychological state of something seeming too good to be true. Their disbelief is caused by overwhelming joy, not skepticism.\n\n**\"The Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms\" (v. 44)**: This represents the threefold division of the Hebrew scriptures (Torah, Nevi'im, Ketuvim), with \"Psalms\" standing for the Writings as its most prominent book.\n\n**Bracketed passages (vv. 40, 51, 52)**: Following the SBLGNT's textual apparatus, these phrases appear in brackets, indicating scholarly uncertainty about whether they were original. I have retained them in brackets rather than omitting them entirely, as they are present in many ancient manuscripts."
