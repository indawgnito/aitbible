      "notes": "**\"The Anointed One\" (v. 1)**: Greek χριστός translates Hebrew *mashiach* (\"messiah\"). While \"Christ\" has become virtually a second name in English, the first-century reader would hear this as a title with royal and priestly connotations—\"the anointed one\" preserves this.\n\n**\"Turning back\" (v. 4, 15)**: Greek μετάνοια is often rendered \"repentance,\" but the modern English word emphasizes feeling sorry. The Greek (and underlying Hebrew *teshuvah*) emphasizes a complete reorientation—turning around and going a different direction.\n\n**\"Release of sins\" (v. 4)**: Greek ἄφεσις means release, letting go, liberation. \"Forgiveness\" works but loses the sense of bondage being broken that ἄφεσις carries.\n\n**\"Being torn open\" (v. 10)**: Greek σχίζω means to tear or rip violently—the same word used when the temple veil is \"torn\" at Jesus's death (15:38). Mark uses this forceful language rather than the gentler \"opened\" found in Matthew and Luke.\n\n**\"The Spirit descending into him\" (v. 10)**: Greek εἰς αὐτόν is \"into him,\" not merely \"upon him\" (ἐπί). Mark's language suggests penetration, not just alighting.\n\n**\"The Spirit drives him out\" (v. 12)**: Greek ἐκβάλλει is the same forceful verb used for casting out demons. Most translations soften this to \"sent\" or \"led,\" but Mark's language is deliberately violent.\n\n**\"The Adversary\" (v. 13)**: Greek Σατανᾶς transliterates Hebrew *satan*, meaning \"adversary\" or \"accuser.\" Preserving this meaning reminds readers this is a title/function, not merely a proper name.\n\n**\"The appointed time\" (v. 15)**: Greek καιρός refers to a decisive or opportune moment, not mere chronological time (χρόνος). It's the pregnant moment when everything changes.\n\n**Historic presents (v. 21, 37, 38, 40, 41, 44)**: Mark frequently shifts to present tense for vividness. I've preserved several instances where the Greek uses present tense (\"they go,\" \"say,\" \"comes\") to maintain Mark's urgent, immediate narrative style.\n\n**\"What do you want with us?\" (v. 24)**: Greek τί ἡμῖν καὶ σοί is a Semitic idiom (lit. \"what to us and to you?\") expressing rejection or a desire for separation—\"Leave us alone!\" or \"What business do you have with us?\"\n\n**\"Becoming angry\" (v. 41)**: The SBLGNT follows manuscripts reading ὀργισθείς (\"becoming angry\") rather than the more common σπλαγχνισθείς (\"having compassion\"). The harder reading is likely original—scribes would more readily change \"angry\" to \"compassionate\" than vice versa. Jesus's anger may be directed at the disease, the purity system that marginalized lepers, or the suffering itself.\n\n**\"Hunted him down\" (v. 36)**: Greek καταδιώκω is a strong verb suggesting pursuit—more intense than simply \"looking for.\"\n\n**\"Drove him out\" (v. 43)**: Again ἐκβάλλω—Jesus \"casts out\" the healed man with the same verb used for exorcism. Combined with the stern warning (ἐμβριμάομαι, a word suggesting snorting or deep agitation), Mark portrays Jesus with striking emotional intensity."

This creates vividness and immediacy. I have preserved this feature rather than smoothing it into past tense, as it reflects Mark's distinctive narrative style.\n\n**\"At home\" (v. 1)**: ἐν οἴκῳ can mean \"in a house\" or \"at home.\" Given that Capernaum served as Jesus's base of operations, \"at home\" captures the sense that he had returned to a familiar place.\n\n**\"Removed the roof... after digging through\" (v. 4)**: The Greek uses cognate emphasis (ἀπεστέγασαν τὴν στέγην, \"unroofed the roof\") and then ἐξορύξαντες (\"having dug out\"). Palestinian roofs were typically made of wooden beams covered with branches and packed mud/clay, which could literally be dug through. This detail reflects the original setting.\n\n**\"Mat\" (vv. 4, 9, 11, 12)**: κράβαττος refers to a poor person's pallet or sleeping mat—a humble piece of bedding, not a proper bed frame. \"Mat\" better captures this than the more formal \"bed.\"\n\n**\"God alone\" (v. 7)**: εἷς ὁ θεός echoes the Shema of Deuteronomy 6:4, which declares the oneness of God. The scribes' theological objection is rooted in Jewish monotheism.\n\n**\"The Son of Man\" (vv. 10, 28)**: This phrase (ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ ἀνθρώπου) renders Aramaic בר נש (bar enash). It functions both as an idiom for \"a human being\" and as an allusion to Daniel 7:13-14, where \"one like a son of man\" receives authority from God. The original audience would have heard both resonances.\n\n**\"Reclining at table\" (v. 15)**: κατακεῖσθαι and συνανέκειντο refer to the practice of reclining on couches during formal meals. Table fellowship was deeply significant—eating with someone implied acceptance and social solidarity. This is why the Pharisees' objection has such force.\n\n**\"Wedding guests\" (v. 19)**: οἱ υἱοὶ τοῦ νυμφῶνος literally means \"sons of the bridal chamber\"—a Semitic idiom for those who participate in the wedding celebration, the bridegroom's companions.\n\n**\"Taken away\" (v. 20)**: ἀπαρθῇ suggests forcible removal, foreshadowing Jesus's violent death. This is the earliest hint of the passion in Mark's Gospel.\n\n**\"Fresh wine... new wineskins\" (v. 22)**: Greek distinguishes νέον (new in time, freshly made) from καινούς (new in quality, unused). Fresh wine still fermenting would burst old, inflexible wineskins.\n\n**\"Humanity\" (vv. 27-28)**: ἄνθρωπος here is generic—referring to human beings as such, not specifically males. \"Humanity\" captures this better than \"man\" in contemporary English."

The image is of hearts that have become calloused and unresponsive.\n\n**\"Afflictions\" (v. 10)**: μάστιγας literally means \"whips\" or \"scourges,\" used metaphorically for diseases or sufferings—illnesses experienced as divine lashings.\n\n**\"Simon the Zealot\" (v. 18)**: Καναναῖον is not \"Canaanite\" but derives from Aramaic קנאן (qan'an), meaning \"zealous one.\" Luke's parallel uses the Greek equivalent Ζηλωτής. This may indicate membership in the Zealot movement or simply fervent religious zeal.\n\n**\"His family\" (v. 21)**: οἱ παρ' αὐτοῦ literally \"those from beside him\"—an idiom for one's relatives or associates. The context (connecting to v. 31) confirms these are his family members.\n\n**\"He has lost his mind\" (v. 21)**: ἐξέστη means \"he is beside himself\" or \"out of his mind\"—his family thought he had become unhinged.\n\n**\"Comparisons\" (v. 23)**: παραβολαῖς—while traditionally \"parables,\" here Jesus is using analogies and comparisons to make his argument, not telling narrative parables.\n\n**\"Sons of men\" (v. 28)**: τοῖς υἱοῖς τῶν ἀνθρώπων is a Semitic idiom meaning \"human beings.\" Retaining \"sons of men\" preserves the Hebrew Bible resonance (cf. Psalm 8:4).\n\n**\"Handed him over\" (v. 19)**: παρέδωκεν can mean \"betrayed,\" but its primary sense is \"handed over, delivered up.\" This translation preserves the ambiguity present in the Greek while also connecting to the theological theme of Jesus being \"handed over\" that runs through the passion narrative."

      "notes": "**\"Mystery\" (v. 11)**: Greek μυστήριον refers not to something puzzling but to a divine secret now being revealed to insiders. This is apocalyptic language—the hidden purposes of God are being disclosed to a chosen group.\n\n**\"So that...lest they turn back and be forgiven\" (v. 12)**: The ἵνα clause presents a notorious interpretive challenge. Mark's Greek straightforwardly indicates purpose (\"in order that\"), citing Isaiah 6:9-10. Some scholars suggest the underlying Aramaic דִּלְמָא could mean \"perhaps\" rather than \"lest,\" but Mark's Greek preserves the harder reading. I have translated it as Mark wrote it.\n\n**\"Temporary\" (v. 17)**: Greek πρόσκαιροι means \"for a season, lasting only a time\"—describing people whose commitment is inherently impermanent, not just coincidentally brief.\n\n**\"Seduction of wealth\" (v. 19)**: Greek ἀπάτη carries the sense of deception, enticement, and false allure—wealth's capacity to mislead about what matters.\n\n**\"Does the lamp come\" (v. 21)**: The Greek personifies the lamp (ἔρχεται ὁ λύχνος)—it \"comes\" as if arriving with a purpose. This odd phrasing may hint that the \"lamp\" represents something (or someone) entering the scene with a mission.\n\n**\"Silence! Be still!\" (v. 39)**: Σιώπα is a simple command for silence. But πεφίμωσο is a perfect passive imperative—\"be muzzled and stay muzzled.\" Jesus speaks to the storm with the same commanding authority he uses against unclean spirits (the verb ἐπιτιμάω, \"rebuke,\" is used for both). The sea's chaos is treated as a hostile force requiring subdual.\n\n**\"Great fear\" (v. 41)**: The cognate construction ἐφοβήθησαν φόβον μέγαν (literally \"they feared a great fear\") emphasizes the overwhelming nature of their response. Ironically, Jesus had just asked why they were afraid (δειλοί); now they experience a deeper fear—the terror of encountering divine power."

The demon attempts to use oath-language against Jesus—a striking reversal.\n\n**\"Legion\" (v. 9)**: A Roman military term for a unit of 5,000-6,000 soldiers. The term carries political resonance in occupied territory; the unclean spirits identify themselves with the vocabulary of imperial occupation.\n\n**\"Subdue\" (v. 4)**: δαμάσαι literally means \"to tame,\" as one tames a wild animal. This language characterizes the man as having become like a wild beast.\n\n**\"Prostrated himself\" (v. 6)**: προσεκύνησεν can mean worship or obeisance; the ambiguity may be intentional—the demons recognize Jesus's divine authority even as they resist it.\n\n**\"The Lord...Jesus\" (vv. 19-20)**: Jesus tells the man to proclaim what \"the Lord\" (ὁ κύριος) has done; the man proclaims what \"Jesus\" has done. Mark lets readers draw the connection.\n\n**\"At death's door\" (v. 23)**: ἐσχάτως ἔχει literally means \"is at the last\" or \"is at the extremity\"—an idiom for being at the point of death.\n\n**\"Saved/healed\" (vv. 23, 28, 34)**: σῴζω carries both meanings. In verse 34, \"your faith has saved you\" deliberately encompasses both physical healing and spiritual restoration.\n\n**\"Affliction\" (vv. 29, 34)**: μάστιξ literally means \"whip\" or \"scourge,\" used metaphorically for a severe affliction. \"Disease\" is too clinical; \"affliction\" preserves the sense of suffering.\n\n**\"Disregarding\" (v. 36)**: παρακούσας can mean either \"overhearing\" or \"ignoring/disregarding.\" Given the context—Jesus responds by telling Jairus not to fear—\"disregarding\" better captures Jesus's deliberate dismissal of the death announcement.\n\n**\"Trust\" (v. 36)**: πίστευε is often rendered \"believe,\" but in this context the call is for active trust in Jesus's power despite the report of death.\n\n**\"Talitha koum\" (v. 41)**: Mark preserves the Aramaic Jesus actually spoke. Ταλιθα is an Aramaic term of endearment for a young girl (literally \"lamb\" or \"little girl\"); κουμ is the imperative \"arise/get up.\"\n\n**Twelve years (vv. 25, 42)**: The woman has suffered for twelve years; the girl is twelve years old. Mark's juxtaposition seems deliberate—the girl's entire life spans the duration of the woman's affliction."

      "notes": "**\"Craftsman\" (v. 3)**: Greek τέκτων is traditionally rendered \"carpenter,\" but the term is broader—a worker in wood, stone, or other building materials. \"Craftsman\" better captures this range while remaining natural.\n\n**\"Took offense\" (v. 3)**: ἐσκανδαλίζοντο literally means \"were caused to stumble.\" The scandal is that Jesus's ordinary origins are a stumbling block to accepting his teaching and power.\n\n**\"Turn back\" (v. 12)**: μετανοέω is typically rendered \"repent,\" but this can sound purely religious to modern ears. The Greek denotes a fundamental change of mind and direction—turning back toward God.\n\n**\"His heart went out to them\" (v. 34)**: ἐσπλαγχνίσθη derives from σπλάγχνα (internal organs), understood as the seat of deep emotion. \"Moved with compassion\" is accurate but clinical; \"his heart went out\" captures the visceral quality.\n\n**\"Sheep without a shepherd\" (v. 34)**: This phrase echoes Numbers 27:17 and Ezekiel 34, where Israel's leaders have failed the people. Mark's audience would recognize this as a loaded image of divine judgment on failed leadership.\n\n**\"Dining groups...garden plots\" (vv. 39-40)**: The Greek uses distributive reduplication: συμπόσια συμπόσια (group by group) and πρασιαὶ πρασιαὶ (literally \"garden bed by garden bed\"). The visual effect is an orderly arrangement on the green grass, evoking a garden scene.\n\n**\"He intended to pass by them\" (v. 48)**: ἤθελεν παρελθεῖν is puzzling if taken at face value. However, \"passing by\" echoes Old Testament theophanies where God \"passes by\" his servants (Exodus 33:19-22; 1 Kings 19:11). This may signal a divine self-revelation.\n\n**\"I am\" (v. 50)**: ἐγώ εἰμι functions grammatically as \"It is I,\" but in context—walking on water, passing by, calming the storm—the echo of the divine name (Exodus 3:14) is likely intentional. I have left it unresolved as \"I am\" to preserve the ambiguity present in the Greek.\n\n**\"Their hearts were hardened\" (v. 52)**: πεπωρωμένη means calloused or petrified. The same term describes Pharaoh's heart in the Septuagint. Mark applies it startlingly to the disciples themselves."

As with the Matthew 6 example, this preserves the theatrical sense—people whose religion is a public act rather than heart-disposition.\n\n**\"Conduct themselves\" (v. 5)**: Greek περιπατοῦσιν literally means \"walk,\" but idiomatically refers to one's manner of life or conduct. This was a standard Jewish metaphor (halakah comes from the Hebrew for \"walk\").\n\n**\"Thoroughly\" (v. 3)**: The Greek πυγμῇ is notoriously difficult—literally \"with the fist.\" Interpretations range from a specific washing technique to an idiom meaning \"diligently.\" I've chosen \"thoroughly\" to convey the sense of careful observance without committing to a specific physical gesture.\n\n**\"Thus declaring all foods clean\" (v. 19)**: The masculine participle καθαρίζων doesn't grammatically agree with anything in the immediate clause. Most scholars read this as Mark's editorial comment, explaining the implications of Jesus's teaching for his Gentile audience. The translation makes this parenthetical function clear.\n\n**\"Evil schemes\" (v. 21)**: Greek διαλογισμοί refers to inner reasonings, calculations, or deliberations—the planning that precedes action. \"Thoughts\" is too passive; these are active mental machinations.\n\n**\"The envious eye\" (v. 22)**: Greek ὀφθαλμὸς πονηρός is a Semitic idiom for envy or stinginess (compare Matthew 20:15). Rendering it literally preserves the idiom, which would have been recognized by readers familiar with Jewish expression.\n\n**\"Could barely speak\" (v. 32)**: Greek μογιλάλον appears only here in the NT and in Isaiah 35:6 LXX, where the prophet promises that \"the tongue of the mute will sing for joy.\" Mark's rare word choice likely signals this prophetic fulfillment.\n\n**\"He has done everything well\" (v. 37)**: This echoes Genesis 1:31 LXX (\"God saw everything that he had made, and behold, it was very good/καλά\").

      "notes": "**\"I am moved with compassion\" (v. 2)**: The Greek σπλαγχνίζομαι derives from σπλάγχνα (internal organs, bowels), expressing a visceral, gut-level emotion. This is stronger than merely \"feeling sorry for\"—it's a deep, physical experience of compassion.\n\n**\"No sign will be given\" (v. 12)**: The Greek εἰ δοθήσεται is a Semitic oath formula where the apodosis is suppressed: \"May God do X to me if a sign is given...\" The construction functions as an emphatic denial, which I have rendered directly rather than preserving the elliptical grammar.\n\n**Two words for baskets (vv. 8, 19-20)**: Mark distinguishes between κόφινοι (v. 19, the feeding of the 5,000) and σπυρίδες (vv. 8, 20, the feeding of the 4,000). The σπυρίς was a larger basket, sometimes large enough to hold a person (cf. Acts 9:25). I use \"baskets\" and \"large baskets\" to preserve this distinction, which Jesus emphasizes in his questioning.\n\n**\"Having eyes, do you not see?\" (v. 18)**: This echoes Jeremiah 5:21 and Ezekiel 12:2 from the Septuagint. The original audience would recognize this prophetic indictment of Israel's spiritual blindness, which then sets up the two-stage healing of the blind man as a commentary on the disciples' gradual understanding.\n\n**\"The Messiah\" (v. 29)**: Greek χριστός translates Hebrew משיח (\"anointed one\"). For a first-century Jewish audience, this title carried specific expectations of a royal deliverer. \"Messiah\" preserves this resonance better than the now-generic \"Christ.\"\n\n**\"Adulterous\" (v. 38)**: Greek μοιχαλίδι uses the prophetic metaphor of adultery for spiritual unfaithfulness to God (cf. Hosea, Jeremiah, Ezekiel). This is not about sexual morality but about covenant betrayal—the generation has been unfaithful to Israel's God.\n\n**Historic present tense**: Mark frequently uses the present tense for vivid narration (λέγει, \"he says\"). I have preserved this where it appears in the Greek rather than smoothing it to past tense, as it captures Mark's characteristic immediacy.\n\n**\"Life\" vs. \"soul\" (vv. 35-37)**: Greek ψυχή means one's life, self, or whole existence—not the disembodied \"soul\" of later Greek philosophy. In this context, Jesus is talking about one's entire life and identity, which \"life\" captures better for modern readers."

      "notes": "**\"Transformed\" (v. 2)**: The Greek μετεμορφώθη is the root of English \"metamorphosis.\" While \"transfigured\" is the traditional rendering and carries appropriate theological weight, \"transformed\" captures the essential meaning—a change in form—without the ecclesiastical overtones that might obscure the strange physicality Mark describes.\n\n**\"Dazzling\" (v. 3)**: The Greek στίλβοντα means gleaming, flashing, radiant. Combined with λίαν (exceedingly), this conveys something more dramatic than merely \"white.\" The comparison to a launderer (γναφεύς—one who bleaches and fulls cloth) emphasizes the otherworldly nature: this whiteness exceeds any human achievement.\n\n**\"Treated as nothing\" (v. 12)**: The Greek ἐξουδενηθῇ means to be utterly rejected, despised, treated as worthless. \"Rejected\" (common in translations) is too mild; the word conveys contemptuous dismissal.\n\n**\"Becomes rigid\" (v. 18)**: The Greek ξηραίνεται literally means \"dries up\" or \"withers,\" but in this context describes the stiffening characteristic of severe seizures—the body going rigid.\n\n**\"'If you can'!\" (v. 23)**: The Greek construction τὸ Εἰ δύνῃ uses the article to quote back the father's words. Jesus is highlighting the conditional as problematic—hence the rendering with quotation marks and exclamation.\n\n**\"Raised him, and he rose\" (v. 27)**: The verbs ἤγειρεν and ἀνέστη are the standard vocabulary for resurrection. Mark may be deliberately evoking resurrection imagery in this healing that follows the boy becoming \"like a corpse.\"\n\n**\"Millstone turned by a donkey\" (v. 42)**: The Greek μύλος ὀνικός specifies the large millstone requiring a donkey to turn it, as opposed to a small hand-mill. This emphasizes the weight—drowning would be certain and immediate.\n\n**\"Gehenna\" (vv. 43, 45, 47)**: I retain \"Gehenna\" rather than \"hell\" because the latter has accumulated centuries of imagery foreign to the original reference—the Valley of Hinnom outside Jerusalem, associated with fire and refuse, and in Jewish tradition with final judgment.\n\n**Verse numbering (vv. 44, 46 omitted)**: Following the critical text, which lacks verses 44 and 46—later manuscripts added these by repeating v. 48 after each warning.\n\n**\"Because you belong to Christ\" (v. 41)**: The Greek ἐν ὀνόματι ὅτι χριστοῦ ἐστε is literally \"in the name that you are of Christ.\" This is one of the few places in Mark where \"Christ\" appears as a title the disciples are identified with."

This agricultural metaphor adds concrete imagery that \"joined\" lacks.\n\n**\"Commits adultery against her\" (v. 11)**: The ἐπ' αὐτήν (\"against her\") is significant and often softened in translation. Jesus portrays the first wife as the wronged party—a striking view in a context where adultery was typically conceived as a wrong against another man whose wife was violated.\n\n**\"His face fell\" (v. 22)**: The verb στυγνάσας describes a darkening or clouding of the countenance—the visible physical expression of inner distress. \"His face fell\" captures this better than the more abstract \"he was sad.\"\n\n**\"Do not defraud\" (v. 19)**: Μὴ ἀποστερήσῃς is not part of the Decalogue. Its inclusion here seems pointedly relevant to a wealthy person—a command against economic exploitation.\n\n**\"Those who are recognized as rulers\" (v. 42)**: The Greek οἱ δοκοῦντες ἄρχειν has a subtle edge—\"those who seem to rule\" or \"those reputed to rule.\" This may hint that such authority is more apparent than real, or simply be a standard idiom for recognized leaders.\n\n**\"Ransom in exchange for\" (v. 45)**: The Greek λύτρον ἀντὶ πολλῶν uses commercial/redemption language. A λύτρον is the price paid to secure release (of a slave, prisoner, or captive), and ἀντί indicates substitution or exchange.\n\n**\"Rabbouni\" (v. 51)**: Retained in Aramaic as Mark does. This is an intensified or more personal form of \"Rabbi\"—\"my master\" or \"my teacher.\" The blind man's use of this intimate address contrasts with his earlier public cries of \"Son of David.\"\n\n**\"Healed you\" / \"see again\" (vv. 51-52)**: The verb σῴζω can mean both \"save\" and \"heal.\" In this context of physical restoration, \"healed\" is primary. The verb ἀναβλέπω means specifically \"to see again\" or \"to recover sight,\" implying Bartimaeus was not born blind."

      "notes": "**Historic present tense**: Mark frequently shifts to present tense for vividness (\"he sends,\" \"they bring,\" \"says to him\"). I preserved many of these to capture Mark's characteristic urgent, immediate narrative style, particularly in dialogue introductions.\n\n**\"The Lord\" (v. 3)**: The Greek ὁ κύριος is ambiguous—it could mean \"the owner\" or \"the Lord\" (a title). The ambiguity appears intentional; on the surface it explains the transaction to the bystanders, but for Mark's readers it carries deeper significance.\n\n**\"Hosanna\" (vv. 9-10)**: Retained as transliteration. This is the Hebrew/Aramaic הושיעה נא (\"Save, please!\") from Psalm 118:25. By the first century it had become a liturgical acclamation, so preserving the word captures what the original audience heard—a familiar festival cry with messianic overtones.\n\n**\"Den of bandits\" (v. 17)**: The Greek λῃστῶν refers to violent robbers or bandits, not petty thieves. In Jeremiah 7:11 (which Jesus quotes), the \"den\" is where bandits retreat to feel safe after their crimes—the critique is not that the temple has become a place of cheating, but that it has become a refuge for those who commit injustice elsewhere while presuming on God's protection.\n\n**\"For all the nations\" (v. 17)**: Mark alone among the Synoptics includes this phrase from Isaiah 56:7. This detail is significant for Mark's likely Gentile audience and highlights that Jesus's action concerns the Court of the Gentiles specifically.\n\n**Verse 19 imperfect tense**: \"They would go out\" captures the iterative force of ἐξεπορεύοντο—this was their regular practice during this period, not a single event.\n\n**\"Believe that you have received it\" (v. 24)**: The aorist ἐλάβετε (\"you received\") is striking—past tense. The grammar suggests believing in the reception as already accomplished, not merely hoping for future fulfillment.\n\n**Verse 26 omitted**: Following the critical text (NA28/SBLGNT), which lacks this verse in the earliest manuscripts. It appears to be a later scribal addition harmonizing with Matthew 6:15."

Either maintains the paradox: what builders rejected becomes structurally essential.\n\n**\"Defer to no one... do not regard people's status\" (v. 14)**: The Greek οὐ μέλει σοι περὶ οὐδενός and οὐ βλέπεις εἰς πρόσωπον ἀνθρώπων are Semitic idioms. The second phrase (\"look at faces\") means showing partiality based on social standing. The questioners' flattery is ironic—they're attempting manipulation by praising Jesus for being immune to manipulation.\n\n**\"Give back\" (v. 17)**: ἀπόδοτε means \"give back, return, repay\"—not merely \"give.\" The implication is that Caesar's things already belong to Caesar (hence have his image), while what bears God's image belongs to God. First-century hearers would catch the allusion: humans bear God's image (Genesis 1:26-27).\n\n**\"Pretense\" (v. 15)**: ὑπόκρισιν here captures their staged sincerity—they're playing a role. \"Hypocrisy\" in modern English suggests believing one thing and doing another, but here the sense is theatrical: a performance designed to entrap.\n\n**\"In the passage about the bush\" (v. 26)**: ἐπὶ τοῦ βάτου is a first-century way of citing scripture by subject matter (before chapter-and-verse divisions existed). It refers to the burning bush narrative in Exodus 3.\n\n**\"With insight\" (v. 34)**: νουνεχῶς means \"sensibly, with understanding, thoughtfully\"—the scribe grasped not just the letter but the spirit of Jesus's answer.\n\n**\"Her whole livelihood\" (v. 44)**: ὅλον τὸν βίον αὐτῆς—βίος here means not \"life\" abstractly but \"means of living, livelihood.\" She gave everything she had to live on."

      "notes": "**\"I am\" (v. 6)**: The Greek Ἐγώ εἰμι is left ambiguous in the source—it could mean \"I am [the Messiah]\" or could echo the divine name (Exodus 3:14). Rather than inserting \"he\" (as many translations do), I preserve the ambiguity that Mark's original readers would have encountered.\n\n**\"Birth pains\" (v. 8)**: The Greek ὠδίνων carries significant eschatological weight. In Jewish apocalyptic tradition, the \"birth pangs of the Messiah\" referred to the period of intense suffering preceding the messianic age. This metaphor suggests not random suffering but labor that produces something—the new age.\n\n**\"Abomination of desolation standing where it should not be\" (v. 14)**: The participle ἑστηκότα is masculine, though βδέλυγμα (\"abomination\") is neuter. This grammatical anomaly may personalize the abomination, pointing to a figure rather than merely an object. The phrase itself alludes to Daniel (9:27, 11:31, 12:11).\n\n**\"Let the reader understand\" (v. 14)**: This editorial aside (ὁ ἀναγινώσκων νοείτω) breaks the narrative frame and speaks directly to whoever is reading Mark's Gospel aloud to a congregation—a striking moment of authorial intrusion.\n\n**\"All flesh\" (v. 20)**: The Semitic idiom πᾶσα σάρξ (\"all flesh\") means \"any living person\" or \"anyone at all.\" I've translated it \"no flesh would be saved\" to preserve the idiomatic feel while making the meaning clear.\n\n**\"The Son\" (v. 32)**: The explicit statement that even the Son does not know the day or hour is textually secure in Mark and represents a striking claim about the limits of Jesus's earthly knowledge.\n\n**\"Late evening... midnight... cockcrow... dawn\" (v. 35)**: These represent the four Roman watches of the night (roughly 6-9pm, 9pm-midnight, midnight-3am, 3-6am). The terminology reflects Mark's Roman audience.\n\n**\"Keep watch\" (v. 33, 34, 35, 37)**: The Greek γρηγορέω (and related ἀγρυπνέω in v. 33) carries both the literal sense of staying physically awake and the metaphorical sense of spiritual vigilance. The repetition of this command four times at the discourse's end creates a drumbeat of urgency."

      "notes": "**\"You say so\" (v. 2)**: The Greek Σὺ λέγεις is deliberately ambiguous—neither a clear affirmation nor denial. Jesus neither claims nor denies the title, leaving Pilate to draw his own conclusions. This evasiveness is characteristic of Jesus's responses throughout the trial.\n\n**\"Handed over\" (vv. 1, 10, 15)**: The verb παραδίδωμι recurs throughout Mark's passion narrative—used of Judas betraying Jesus, the Sanhedrin delivering him to Pilate, and Pilate delivering him for crucifixion. This repetition creates a chain of \"handing over\" that the translation preserves.\n\n**\"Insurrectionists\" (v. 7)**: στασιαστῶν refers to those involved in political rebellion against Rome. Barabbas was not merely a criminal but a revolutionary—making the crowd's choice between him and Jesus politically charged.\n\n**\"Salute\" (v. 18)**: ἀσπάζεσθαι combined with \"Hail\" (Χαῖρε) parodies the imperial greeting \"Ave Caesar.\" The mockery is a grotesque parody of Roman imperial ceremony.\n\n**\"Doing obeisance\" (v. 19)**: προσεκύνουν can mean \"worship\" but also the physical act of prostration before royalty. The soldiers are performing mock homage, not religious worship—though Mark's readers would recognize the irony.\n\n**\"God's son\" (v. 39)**: The Greek υἱὸς θεοῦ lacks the definite article. The centurion, a pagan, might mean \"a son of a god\" in Greco-Roman terms, while Mark's readers would understand the fuller Christian meaning. \"God's son\" preserves this productive ambiguity better than \"the Son of God\" or \"a son of God.\"\n\n**Verse 28**: This verse, which reads \"And the scripture was fulfilled that says, 'He was counted among the lawless,'\" is absent from the earliest manuscripts and thus omitted following the critical text.\n\n**\"Hurling insults\" (v. 29)**: ἐβλασφήμουν literally means \"blaspheming,\" but the word's range in Greek includes reviling or speaking abusively. The irony is that the mockers, not Jesus, are the true blasphemers.\n\n**\"Abandoned\" (v. 34)**: While \"forsaken\" is traditional, ἐγκατέλιπες (from Psalm 22:1) carries the sense of being left behind, abandoned. Jesus quotes the opening of a psalm that moves from desperation to vindication—a fact first-century Jewish listeners would recognize.\n\n**\"Breathed his last\" (v. 37)**: ἐξέπνευσεν literally means \"breathed out\" or \"expired.\" The same verb appears in v. 39, linking Jesus's death to the centurion's confession."

      "notes": "**Verses 9-20 and the \"Shorter Ending\" omitted**: The double-bracketed material in the source text represents later additions not found in the earliest and most reliable manuscripts (including Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus). Mark's Gospel, as originally preserved, ends at verse 8 with the startling phrase \"for they were afraid.\" The abruptness—ending a Greek sentence with γάρ (\"for\") is almost unparalleled—has generated centuries of scholarly debate about whether this was Mark's intended ending or whether the original conclusion was lost.\n\n**Historical presents preserved (vv. 2, 4, 6)**: Mark's Gospel frequently uses present-tense verbs in past-time narration (\"they come,\" \"they see,\" \"he says\") to create vivid immediacy. I retained these rather than smoothing them into past tense.\n\n**\"He has been raised\" (v. 6)**: The Greek ἠγέρθη is an aorist passive—\"was raised\" with an implied divine agent. This is the so-called \"divine passive,\" indicating God as the one who raised Jesus without naming God directly.\n\n**\"Utterly overcome with alarm\" (v. 5)**: The verb ἐξεθαμβήθησαν (found only in Mark in the NT) is intensified by its prefix and conveys overwhelming, disorienting alarm—stronger than mere surprise.\n\n**\"Trembling and bewilderment\" (v. 8)**: The Greek τρόμος καὶ ἔκστασις pairs physical trembling with ἔκστασις—literally \"standing outside oneself,\" a state of being displaced from normal consciousness by overwhelming experience. \"Bewilderment\" captures this better than \"amazement,\" which sounds too positive.\n\n**\"And Peter\" (v. 7)**: The singling out of Peter alongside \"his disciples\" is striking—likely acknowledging Peter's denial while assuring his restoration."
