      "notes": "**\"The Elder\" (v. 1)**: The Greek *ho presbyteros* is used here as a specific title of authority within the Johannine community, rather than merely an indication of advanced age.\n\n**\"Journey may be smooth... journeying well\" (v. 2)**: The Greek *euodousthai* literally means \"to have a good way\" or \"to have a successful journey.\" While often translated as \"prosper,\" the word carries the nuance of things going well for someone as they move through life. The translation preserves the link between the physical \"journey\" and the \"journeying\" of the *psychē* (inner life/soul).\n\n**\"Living\" (v. 3, 4)**: The Greek *peripateis* (literally \"walking\") is a common Semitic idiom (reflecting the Hebrew *halakhah*) referring to a person's conduct, lifestyle, and moral path. \"Living\" or \"living out\" captures the active, lifestyle-oriented nature of the term better than the literal \"walk.\"\n\n**\"The Truth\" (v. 1, 3, 4, 8, 12)**: In the Johannine writings, *alētheia* is more than factual accuracy; it is a near-technical term for the reality of God revealed in Christ and the lifestyle that flows from it. \n\n**\"Provide for their journey\" (v. 6)**: The Greek *propempsas* means more than just saying goodbye; it refers to the practice of providing travelers with food, money, and companions to ensure they reach their next destination safely.\n\n**\"The Name\" (v. 7)**: The Greek *tou onomatos* is used absolutely here. To the original audience, this was a clear reference to the name and authority of Jesus, echoing the Jewish practice of referring to Yahweh as *HaShem* (\"The Name\") to avoid speaking the divine name.\n\n**\"Sustain\" (v. 8)**: The Greek *hypolambanein* carries the sense of \"taking up\" or \"supporting from below.\" It implies a duty of hospitality and material support.\n\n**\"Who loves to be the one in charge\" (v. 9)**: The Greek *philoprōteuōn* is a rare and biting term for someone who is power-hungry or loves to be first.\n\n**\"Malicious nonsense\" (v. 10)**: The verb *phlyarōn* refers to empty, senseless, or gossiping talk. Diotrephes is not making substantive charges; he is \"talking trash\" or \"babbling\" against the Elder.\n\n**\"Mouth to mouth\" (v. 14)**: This is a literal rendering of the Greek *stoma pros stoma*. It is a Semitic idiom (found in the LXX in Numbers 12:8) for intimate, direct communication without intermediaries or tools. \"Face to face\" is the modern equivalent, but \"mouth to mouth\" preserves the specific flavor of the original text.\n\n**\"Friends\" (v. 15)**: The use of *philoi* (\"friends\") instead of \"brothers\" or \"saints\" is unique to 3 John in the closing of a New Testament letter, perhaps indicating a closer-knit or more embattled circle of associates."
