      "notes": "**“The scroll of the lineage” (v. 1)**: The Greek *Biblos geneseōs* echoes the Septuagint’s phrasing in Genesis 2:4 and 5:1. It suggests not just a \"family tree\" but a \"record of origins\" or \"account of the new creation\" beginning with Jesus.\n\n**The Genealogy (v. 2–16)**: The Greek *egennēsen* (\"fathered\" or \"begat\") is used consistently in the active voice for the men, but the pattern breaks in verse 16. There, the verb becomes passive (*egen nēthē*—\"was born/begotten\") and refers back to Mary (*ex hēs*, feminine singular). This grammatically excludes Joseph from the biological fatherhood of Jesus, maintaining the narrative of the virginal conception.\n\n**“Asaph” and “Amos” (v. 7, 10)**: Following the SBLGNT/NA28 critical text, these names appear as the psalmist/prophet names rather than the kings \"Asa\" and \"Amon.\" Matthew may have used these spellings intentionally or followed a specific tradition of the royal list.\n\n**“Deportation” (v. 11, 12, 17)**: *Metoikesia* refers to a forced change of abode or migration. \"Exile\" is a common translation, but \"deportation\" captures the political reality of the Babylonian action.\n\n**“A man committed to the Law” (v. 19)**: The Greek *dikaios* is traditionally \"just\" or \"righteous.\" In a first-century Jewish context, this specifically means someone who is observant of the Torah. Joseph’s dilemma is that the Law (Deut. 22:20–21) seems to require public exposure, yet his \"righteousness\" is tempered by a desire for mercy, leading to the decision for a \"quiet\" divorce.\n\n**“Jesus” / “He will save” (v. 21)**: This is a direct wordplay that an Aramaic or Hebrew speaker would immediately recognize. The name *Iēsous* (from the Hebrew *Yeshua*) literally means \"The LORD saves\" or \"Salvation.\" The explanation \"for he (*autos*) will save (*sōsei*)\" clarifies the meaning of the name.\n\n**“Intimate relations” (v. 25)**: The Greek *eginōsken* (\"know\") is a standard Semitic euphemism (the Aramaic *yeda*) for sexual intercourse. The translation uses \"intimate relations\" to make the meaning clear to a modern reader."

      "notes": "**\"Magi\" (v. 1, 7, 16)**: The Greek *magoi* refers to a specific class of Zoroastrian priest-astrologers from the Persian/Babylonian region. Translating this as \"wise men\" or \"kings\" obscures their historical identity as experts in celestial omens, which is central to why they followed a star.\n\n**\"In its rising\" (v. 2, 9)**: The Greek *en tē anatolē* is often translated as \"in the East,\" but in an astronomical context, it specifically refers to the heliacal rising of a star (its first appearance on the horizon before sunrise). This explains the Magi's technical observation.\n\n**\"Do him homage\" (v. 2, 8, 11)**: The verb *proskyneō* denotes the physical act of prostrating oneself or bowing deeply. In this context, it refers to the royal protocol of the Ancient Near East rather than \"worship\" in the modern, exclusively religious sense.\n\n**\"Messiah\" (v. 4)**: The Greek *ho christos* is the translation of the Hebrew *Mashiach* (the Anointed One). Using \"the Messiah\" preserves the Jewish sectarian and political expectations Herod was investigating.\n\n**\"The child\" (v. 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 20)**: The Greek *paidion* denotes a young child or toddler, as opposed to *brephos* (infant/newborn). This aligns with Herod’s order to kill boys up to two years old (v. 16), suggesting some time had passed since the birth.\n\n**\"Outwitted\" (v. 16)**: *Enepaichthē* literally means \"was played with\" or \"mocked.\" In this context, it carries the sense of being made a fool of or tricked by the Magi’s failure to report back.\n\n**\"Nazarene\" (v. 23)**: Matthew cites \"the prophets\" (plural), yet no specific Old Testament verse says the Messiah will be called a \"Nazarene.\" This is likely a wordplay on the Hebrew *netzer* (\"branch\") from Isaiah 11:1, or perhaps an allusion to the *nazir* (Nazirite) tradition. Because the Greek *Nazōraios* preserves this phonetic link, it is retained."

It is not merely a feeling of remorse but a total reorientation of one’s life and priorities.\n\n**\"Kingdom of the Heavens\" (v. 2)**: Matthew preserves the plural \"heavens\" (*tōn ouranōn*), reflecting the Hebrew/Aramaic idiom. It also honors the Jewish practice of using \"Heaven\" as a reverent metonym for God.\n\n**\"Spawn of vipers\" (v. 7)**: The Greek *gennēmata* refers to offspring or brood. It suggests that the religious leaders are not just behaving like snakes, but share the very nature of the \"serpent\" from the beginning.\n\n**\"Stones/Children\" (v. 9)**: This is a clear Aramaic/Hebrew wordplay that the original audience would recognize: God can raise up \"children\" (*banim*) from \"stones\" (*abanim*).\n\n**\"Carry his sandals\" (v. 11)**: Carrying or removing sandals was the task of the lowest slave. John is emphasizing the vast qualitative difference between his own authority and that of the coming Messiah.\n\n**\"Winnowing shovel\" (v. 12)**: The *ptyon* was a wooden fork or shovel used to throw threshed grain into the air so the wind could blow away the lighter chaff (*achyron*), leaving the heavier grain to fall on the threshing floor.\n\n**\"Every requirement of God’s righteousness\" (v. 15)**: The term *dikaiosynē* here refers to \"covenant faithfulness\" or \"doing what is right in God’s eyes.\" Jesus is not suggesting he is a sinner who needs repentance, but that his submission to John’s baptism is a necessary step in God’s unfolding plan of salvation.\n\n**\"The Beloved\" (v. 17)**: The Greek *ho agapētos* is more than an adjective; it functions as a Messianic title. It alludes to the \"beloved son\" Isaac (Genesis 22) and the \"Servant\" of God (Isaiah 42:1), signaling that Jesus is the unique heir and the one who will suffer."

      "notes": "**\"The Slanderer\" (v. 1, 5, 8, 11)**: The Greek *diabolos* literally means \"one who throws [insults/accusations] across.\" While \"Devil\" is the traditional English derivative, \"Slanderer\" or \"Accuser\" captures the functional role this figure plays in the divine court and in this narrative of testing.\n\n**\"Tested\" (v. 1, 3, 7)**: The verb *peirazō* can mean \"tempt\" (solicit to sin) or \"test\" (prove the quality of). Given the echoes of Israel’s forty-year testing in the wilderness, \"test\" or \"prove\" is the primary sense here.\n\n**\"Every utterance\" (v. 4)**: The Greek *rhēmati* refers to a specific spoken word or thing said, rather than the more abstract *logos*. It emphasizes that life is sustained by the ongoing, active speech of God.\n\n**\"Highest parapet\" (v. 5)**: *Pterugion* literally means \"little wing.\" In an architectural context, it refers to the highest extremity or a finial/parapet of the temple complex.\n\n**\"Messengers\" (v. 6, 11)**: The Greek *angeloi* are simply \"messengers.\" While \"angels\" is a common loanword, it often triggers modern celestial imagery that can obscure their role as God’s agents or couriers.\n\n**\"Sacred duty\" (v. 10)**: The verb *latreuō* refers specifically to religious service or cultic worship offered to a deity.\n\n**\"Handed over\" (v. 12)**: *Paredothē* is a significant term in Matthew. It is the same word used later for Jesus being \"betrayed\" or \"delivered up.\" It carries a weight of judicial or providential handing over to one's fate.\n\n**\"Change your hearts and minds\" (v. 17)**: The Greek *metanoeite* is traditionally \"repent,\" but \"repentance\" in modern English often implies merely feeling sorry. The Greek term implies a radical change in one’s *nous* (mind/perspective), leading to a change in the direction of one’s life.\n\n**\"Kingdom of the heavens\" (v. 17)**: Matthew consistently uses the plural \"heavens\" (*ouranōn*), following the Hebrew/Aramaic plural *shamayim*. \n\n**\"Moon-struck\" (v. 24)**: The Greek *selēniazomenous* literally means to be affected by the moon. While this referred to what we now call epilepsy, the translation retains the original audience's understanding of the condition's source."

      "notes": "**\"Blessed\" (vv. 3–11)**: The Greek *makarioi* implies more than a feeling of happiness; it describes a state of being honored or flourishing under God’s favor. Given the counter-cultural nature of the list, it suggests that those the world considers \"losers\" are actually the ones God \"congratulates.\"\n\n**\"Gentle in their strength\" (v. 5)**: This renders *praeis*. In the first century, this was not a \"weak\" word; it described power that had been tamed or bridled (like a warhorse) or the gentleness of a ruler who has the power to act but chooses kindness.\n\n**\"The heavens\" (vv. 3, 10, 12, etc.)**: The Greek *tōn ouranōn* is plural, reflecting the Hebrew *shamayim*. Matthew uses this phrase (\"Kingdom of the Heavens\") as a reverent Jewish circumlocution for \"Kingdom of God.\"\n\n**\"Bring them to their intended fullness\" (v. 17)**: *Plērōsai* means to fill up or complete. Jesus is not just \"keeping\" the law; he is bringing it to the destination it was always traveling toward.\n\n**\"Iota... stroke\" (v. 18)**: The \"iota\" refers to the *yod*, the smallest Hebrew letter. The \"stroke\" (*keraia*) refers to the tiny decorative \"horn\" or serif that distinguishes similar Hebrew letters.\n\n**\"Empty-head\" / \"You fool!\" (v. 22)**: *Rhaka* is an Aramaic term of contempt for someone’s intelligence (*reka*). *Mōre* is Greek for \"fool\" but in a Semitic context, it often carried the weight of the Hebrew *mōreh*, implying a \"rebel\" against God.\n\n**\"Gehenna\" (vv. 22, 29, 30)**: This is retained as a loanword. It refers to the Valley of Hinnom (*Ge-Hinnom*) outside Jerusalem, a place associated with child sacrifice in Israel’s past and later used as a smoldering refuse heap. It serves as a vivid metaphor for the destruction of the person.\n\n**\"Causes you to stumble\" (vv. 29–30)**: The Greek *skandalizei* refers to a trap-spring or a stumbling block that causes a downfall.\n\n**\"Do not violently resist\" (v. 39)**: The verb *antistēnai* often carries a legal or military connotation of \"standing against\" or \"counter-attacking.\" Jesus is prohibiting a cycle of violent retaliation.\n\n**\"Tunic... cloak\" (v. 40)**: The *chitōn* was the inner garment (worn against the skin), while the *himation* was the expensive outer cloak. To give both was to be left naked, shaming the creditor who took a person's basic dignity.\n\n**\"Forces you to go one mile\" (v. 41)**: This refers to *angareia*, the legal right of a Roman soldier to press a civilian into service to carry their gear for one mile.\n\n**\"Perfectly mature\" (v. 48)**: *Teleios* does not mean \"flawless\" in the modern sense but \"complete,\" \"whole,\" or \"having reached its end-goal.\" In the context of v. 45, it refers to an impartial, all-encompassing love that mimics God's own \"complete\" character."

      "notes": "**\"Performers\" (v. 2, 5, 16)**: The Greek *hypokritai* refers to stage actors. In this context, it describes those whose religious life is a theatrical display intended for an audience rather than a sincere expression of devotion.\n\n**\"Received their payment in full\" (v. 2, 5, 16)**: The verb *apechousin* was a technical term in the Greco-Roman business world used on receipts to indicate that a debt had been paid in full. The transaction is complete; they have no further claim to a reward from God.\n\n**\"Innermost room\" (v. 6)**: The *tameion* was a private interior room, often a storage closet or treasury, and was the only room in a typical Palestinian house that could be locked from the inside.\n\n**\"Babble\" / \"Long-windedness\" (v. 7)**: *Battalogēsēte* (babble) and *polylogia* (much-speaking) refer to the practice in pagan prayer of reciting long lists of divine names and formulas to \"coerce\" a deity into listening.\n\n**\"Bread we need for the coming day\" (v. 11)**: The word *epiousion* is extremely rare. While traditionally \"daily,\" it more likely derives from *hē epiousa* (\"the coming day\"). In an Aramaic-speaking context, this petitions God for the subsistence bread required for the immediate future.\n\n**\"Debts\" (v. 12)**: In the Aramaic substrate of Jesus’s teaching, \"debt\" (*choba*) was a standard idiom for \"sin.\" The Greek *opheilēmata* preserves this legal/financial metaphor for moral failure.\n\n**\"Time of trial\" (v. 13)**: *Peirasmos* can mean temptation to sin, but in the context of Jewish apocalyptic thought and the Lord’s Prayer, it likely refers to the \"great trial\" or time of testing that precedes the establishment of God’s kingdom.\n\n**\"Sincere\" vs. \"Malicious\" (v. 22-23)**: The Greek *haplous* (literally \"single\" or \"simple\") carries a secondary Jewish meaning of \"generous.\" Conversely, the \"evil eye\" (*ponēros*) was a common Semitic idiom for stinginess, envy, or malice. The \"lamp of the body\" teaching is about one's moral lens and generosity.\n\n**\"Mammon\" (v. 24)**: This is a transliteration of the Aramaic word for wealth or property. Jesus personifies it as a rival deity to emphasize that wealth exerts a \"mastery\" over the human heart.\n\n**\"Span of life\" (v. 27)**: While *hēlikia* can mean physical height, a \"cubit\" (about 18 inches) was also used metaphorically to describe a measure of time. Since few people worry about being 18 inches taller, but many worry about living longer, \"span of life\" better captures the intent."

The translation uses \"timber\" to emphasize the absurdly large scale of the beam compared to the speck, which was a common Semitic hyperbole.\n\n**\"Performer\" (v. 5)**: *Hypokrita* originally referred to a stage actor. Jesus is not just calling them inconsistent (the modern sense of \"hypocrite\"), but is critiquing their religious life as a theatrical display for an audience.\n\n**\"What is holy\" (v. 6)**: *To hagion* likely refers to the \"holy meat\" of temple sacrifices. In a first-century Jewish context, giving sanctified meat to scavengers like dogs would be a profound desecration.\n\n**\"Prone to evil\" (v. 11)**: *Ponēroi* (\"evil\" or \"wicked\"). Jesus uses this in a relative sense, contrasting human fallibility and the inherent self-interest of human nature with the perfect goodness of the heavenly Father.\n\n**\"Cramped\" (v. 14)**: The Greek *tethlimmenē* comes from a root meaning \"to compress\" or \"to squeeze.\" It suggests a path that is not only narrow but difficult and restrictive, involving pressure or tribulation.\n\n**\"Diseased\" (v. 17-18)**: *Sapron* means rotten, decaying, or of poor quality. In the context of a tree, \"diseased\" or \"rotten\" captures the biological sense of why a tree produces \"bad\" (*ponērous*) fruit.\n\n**\"Acts of power\" (v. 22)**: *Dynameis* is often translated as \"miracles,\" but specifically refers to deeds that manifest divine power.\n\n**\"Lawlessness\" (v. 23)**: *Anomian* literally means \"being without law\" or \"violating the Law.\" In Matthew’s Gospel, this specifically refers to conduct that ignores the true intent of the Torah as interpreted by Jesus. The phrase is a quotation from Psalm 6:8.\n\n**\"Sensible\" (v. 24)**: *Phronimō* refers to practical wisdom, prudence, or \"street-smarts\" in a spiritual sense—knowing how to act on information, not just possessing it.\n\n**\"Scholars of the Law\" (v. 29)**: *Grammateis* (traditionally \"scribes\") were the professional class of experts in the interpretation and application of the Mosaic Law. \"Scholars\" better reflects their social and academic status."

      "notes": "**\"Skin disease\" (v. 2)**: The Greek *lepra* is traditionally \"leprosy,\" but in the first century, it referred to a variety of scaling skin conditions (including psoriasis or infections) that rendered a person ritually unclean under Levitical law, not exclusively Hansen’s disease.\n\n**\"Knelt in homage\" (v. 2)**: *Prosekunei* refers to the physical act of prostrating oneself or kneeling. In this context, it carries the weight of acknowledging Jesus’s superior authority, bordering on or expressing divine worship.\n\n**\"Servant\" / \"Boy\" (v. 6)**: The Greek *pais* can mean \"son\" or \"servant.\" In a military context, it often refers to a personal servant or armor-bearer for whom the officer feels a personal responsibility.\n\n**\"Recline at the banquet table\" (v. 11)**: *Anaklithēsontai* literally means \"to recline.\" This refers to the Middle Eastern custom of reclining on couches during a formal feast. It evokes the \"Messianic Banquet\" expected by Jews in the age to come.\n\n**\"Natural heirs of the kingdom\" (v. 12)**: *Hoi hyioi tēs basileias* (literally \"the sons of the kingdom\") refers to those who, by covenant and lineage, expected to inherit the kingdom but are warned of exclusion due to lack of faith.\n\n**\"Torah scholar\" (v. 19)**: *Grammateus* is traditionally \"scribe.\" In this context, it refers to an expert in the interpretation and teaching of the Mosaic Law.\n\n**\"Son of Man\" (v. 20)**: This is Jesus’s preferred self-designation, evoking the \"one like a son of man\" in Daniel 7:13-14, who is given everlasting dominion, while also emphasizing his shared humanity.\n\n**\"Let the dead bury their own dead\" (v. 22)**: This is likely a hyperbolic Aramaic idiom. Jesus is not necessarily forbidding a funeral, but rather challenging the disciple to prioritize the immediate call of the kingdom over social and familial obligations, however sacred.\n\n**\"Massive upheaval\" (v. 24)**: The Greek *seismos megas* usually means \"great earthquake.\" Its use here for a storm at sea suggests a violent, earth-shaking disturbance of the elements.\n\n**\"What do you want with us\" (v. 29)**: *Ti hēmin kai soi* is a Semitic idiom (Hebrew: *mah-lanu walak*) meaning \"What is there to us and to you?\" It functions as a way of saying, \"Why are you interfering with us?\" or \"Leave us alone.\""

      "notes": "**\"His own city\" (v. 1)**: Refers to Capernaum, which Jesus had made his headquarters (Matt 4:13) after leaving Nazareth.\n\n**\"Sins are released\" (v. 2, 5)**: The Greek *aphiēmi* means to let go, dismiss, or cancel a debt. While \"forgive\" is the traditional religious term, \"release\" captures the Aramaic and Greek legal sense of being freed from the burden and penalty of sin.\n\n**\"Scholars of the Law\" (v. 3)**: *Grammateis* (scribes) were the professional class of Torah experts and legalists.\n\n**\"Authority to human beings\" (v. 8)**: The Greek *tois anthrōpois* is plural. While Jesus is the \"Son of Man\" (the unique human figure from Daniel 7), the crowd marvels that God has mediated this divine power to humanity.\n\n**\"Tax collector’s booth\" (v. 9)**: The *telōnion* was a customs house. Matthew was likely a *telōnēs*, a contractor for Roman tax revenues, often viewed as a ritual outcast and a collaborator.\n\n**\"Self-righteous\" (v. 13)**: The Greek *dikaioi* usually means \"righteous,\" but in this polemical context against the Pharisees, Jesus is using the term ironically to refer to those who presume their own standing before God.\n\n**\"Wedding guests\" (v. 15)**: The Greek *huioi tou nymphōnos* (\"sons of the bridal chamber\") is a Semitic idiom for the friends of the groom or wedding guests.\n\n**\"Ritual tassel\" (v. 20)**: The *kraspedon* refers to the *tzitzit*, the ritual tassels required by the Law (Numbers 15:38) to be worn on the corners of a garment. This highlights the woman's reach for Jesus's identity as a Torah-observant Jew.\n\n**\"Restored to wholeness\" (v. 21, 22)**: The Greek *sōzō* means \"to save,\" but in medical contexts, it specifically refers to being healed or made whole. \n\n**\"Mourning uproar\" (v. 23)**: First-century Jewish funerals involved professional mourners and flute players (as mentioned here) to create a public display of grief.\n\n**\"Was raised up\" (v. 25)**: The verb *ēgerthē* is the same word used for \"resurrected.\" Matthew is signaling that this is more than just waking up; it is a foretaste of the resurrection.\n\n**\"Son of David\" (v. 27)**: A specific Messianic title emphasizing the kingly lineage of the deliverer.\n\n**\"Sternly warned\" (v. 30)**: The Greek *enebrimēthē* is a very strong word, sometimes used for the snorting of a horse. It implies a rigorous, even indignant charge.\n\n**\"Distressed and dejected\" (v. 36)**: The Greek *eskyulmenoi* (literally \"flayed/skinned\") and *errimmenoi* (literally \"thrown down/abandoned\") paint a vivid picture of sheep that have been attacked and left for dead by negligent leaders.\n\n**\"Send out\" (v. 38)**: The Greek *ekbalē* is a forceful verb, literally \"to hurl out\" or \"drive out.\" It is the same word used for Jesus driving out demons. The workers are not just \"sent\" but \"thrust\" into the field."

      "notes": "**Emissaries (v. 2)**: The Greek *apostoloi* refers to authorized messengers or agents sent with the authority of the sender. While \"apostle\" is the traditional transliteration, \"emissary\" or \"authorized agent\" captures the functional legal nuance of the *shaliach* in Jewish tradition.\n\n**Handed him over (v. 4, 17, 19, 21)**: The verb *paradidōmi* is used consistently for Judas’s action against Jesus and the persecution of the disciples. Using \"handed over\" instead of \"betrayed\" preserves the author's intentional linguistic connection between the fate of the Master and the fate of the disciples.\n\n**Zealot (v. 4)**: The Greek *Kananaios* is a transliteration of the Aramaic *qan’ana*, which means \"zealot.\" It likely refers to Simon’s political or religious faction rather than his geographic origin (Cana).\n\n**Kingdom of the Heavens (v. 7)**: This reflects Matthew’s consistent use of the plural *ouranoi* and the Jewish practice of using \"the Heavens\" as a metonym for God to avoid speaking the divine name directly.\n\n**Innocent (v. 16)**: The Greek *akeraioi* literally means \"unmixed\" or \"pure.\" In this context, it suggests a simplicity of motive or lack of guile, contrasting with the shrewdness of the serpent.\n\n**Local councils (v. 17)**: The Greek *synedria* (Sanhedrins) refers to local Jewish judicial bodies, not necessarily the Great Sanhedrin in Jerusalem.\n\n**Beelzebul (v. 25)**: Likely derived from the Philistine \"Baal-Zebub\" (Lord of the Flies) or the Hebrew \"Baal-Zebul\" (Lord of the Prince/Manor/Dung). It was a contemporary epithet for the prince of demons.\n\n**Soul (v. 28, 39)**: The Greek *psychē* corresponds to the Hebrew *nephesh*, meaning the whole person, the life-force, or the essential self. The English \"soul\" often carries a dualistic Greek philosophical weight, but here it refers to the life that God sustains beyond physical death.\n\n**Gehenna (v. 28)**: A reference to the Valley of Hinnom (*Ge Hinnom*) outside Jerusalem, which served as a historical site of child sacrifice and later a refuse dump. It was the standard 1st-century Jewish metaphor for the place of final judgment.\n\n**Assarion (v. 29)**: A specific small Roman copper coin worth 1/16th of a denarius. Retaining the specific term emphasizes the insignificance of the price.\n\n**Acknowledges me (v. 32)**: The Greek *homologeō en emoi* follows a Semitic idiom (confess *in* me), implying a public declaration of allegiance or a union of identity.\n\n**Take up his cross (v. 38)**: To a first-century audience, the *stauros* (cross) was not a religious symbol but a terrifying instrument of state execution and public humiliation used by Rome to crush insurrection. Jesus is using a metaphor for total submission to a path that leads to death.\n\n**Because he is (v. 41-42)**: The Greek phrase *eis onoma* (literally \"into the name of\") is a Semitic idiom meaning \"for the sake of,\" \"by reason of,\" or \"in the capacity of.\" It indicates that the person is being received specifically because of their role as a prophet, righteous person, or disciple."

      "notes": "**\"The Christ\" (v. 2)**: The Greek *tou christou* includes the definite article, signaling it as a title (\"The Messiah\") rather than a proper name. John is questioning if Jesus is fulfilling the specific office he expected.\n\n**\"The Coming One\" (v. 3)**: *Ho erchomenos* was a contemporary Messianic title based on passages like Psalm 118:26 and Habakkuk 2:3.\n\n**\"Stumble\" (v. 6)**: *Skandalisthe* refers to the *skandalon*, the trigger of a trap. It describes someone being tripped up or falling away because Jesus did not fit their expectations of the Messiah (e.g., John being in prison while the \"Coming One\" is present).\n\n**\"Breaking through with force\" (v. 12)**: The Greek *biazetai* is notoriously difficult. It can be passive (\"is being treated violently\") or middle (\"is forcing its way forward\"). Given the context of John’s imprisonment and the Aramaic substratum (*perats*), it likely refers to the Kingdom's dynamic, forceful entry into the world which provokes a violent reaction from \"violent men\" (*biastai*).\n\n**\"Wisdom is vindicated by her works\" (v. 19)**: Some manuscripts read \"children\" (*teknōn*), but the SBLGNT follows the earlier \"works\" (*ergōn*). This creates a literary frame with verse 2, where John hears of the \"works\" of the Christ. Wisdom’s \"works\" are the deeds of Jesus and John, regardless of the generation's criticism.\n\n**\"Acts of power\" (v. 20, 21, 23)**: *Dunameis* is often translated as \"miracles,\" but it literally means \"powers\" or \"mighty deeds.\" To the original audience, these weren't just wonders to behold, but outbursts of the power of the coming Kingdom.\n\n**\"Hades\" (v. 23)**: Retained as a loanword. In the Septuagint, it corresponds to *Sheol*, the realm of the dead. It stands in contrast to the height of \"heaven.\"\n\n**\"Public praise\" (v. 25)**: *Exomologoumai* means more than a private \"thank you.\" It is a grateful, public acknowledgment of God's sovereignty.\n\n**\"Easy to bear\" (v. 30)**: The Greek *chrēstos* can mean \"kind,\" \"good,\" or \"well-fitting.\" In the context of a yoke, it suggests a harness that does not chafe the neck—one that is shaped perfectly for the wearer."

Jesus is not simply saying \"I am greater than the temple,\" but that something about the situation—the arrival of the Kingdom and his messianic presence—surpasses the temple institution. This is repeated in verses 41 and 42 regarding Jonah and Solomon.\n\n**Mercy and not sacrifice** (v. 7): A direct quote of Hosea 6:6. In the Hebrew context, this is a comparative idiom (dialectical negation) meaning \"mercy rather than mere ritual.\"\n\n**Son of Man** (v. 8): Jesus' preferred self-designation, evoking the \"one like a son of man\" in Daniel 7:13-14 who is given everlasting dominion by the Ancient of Days.\n\n**Withered hand** (v. 10): The Greek *xēran* (dry/wasted) suggests a limb that was atrophied or paralyzed, making it a permanent disability rather than an acute injury.\n\n**Justice** (v. 18, 20): The Greek *krisin* refers to the Hebrew *mishpat*—not just legal sentencing, but the establishment of God's right order and justice in the world.\n\n**Beelzebul** (v. 24): Likely derived from *Baal-Zebub* (Lord of the Flies) or *Baal-Zebul* (Lord of the Manor/Prince Baal). By Jesus' time, it was a popular name for the prince of demons.\n\n**Defamation of the Spirit** (v. 31): The Greek *blasphēmia* refers to slander or speaking impiously. In this context, it is the specific act of attributing the clear work of the Holy Spirit (healing and deliverance) to the power of the devil.\n\n**Idle word** (v. 36): *Argon* literally means \"not working\" or \"unproductive.\" It refers to words that are careless, useless, or fail to accomplish the good they ought to.\n\n**Unfaithful generation** (v. 39): *Moichalis* literally means \"adulterous,\" but in the context of the Hebrew prophets, spiritual adultery referred to covenant unfaithfulness toward God.\n\n**Sea monster** (v. 40): The Greek *kētos* refers to any large sea creature or monster, not specifically a whale.\n\n**Unoccupied** (v. 44): *Scholazonta* (from which we get \"school\") means \"at leisure\" or \"empty.\" The house is clean but lacks a new master (the Spirit), leaving it vulnerable.\n\n**Verse 47**: This verse (\"Someone told him, 'Look, your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak to you'\") is omitted because it is absent from several of the most important early manuscripts (including Sinaiticus and Vaticanus) and is likely a later harmonization from Mark 3:32 or Luke 8:20."

      "notes": "**\"Kingdom of the Heavens\" (v. 11, etc.)**: This is a literal rendering of the Greek *basileia tōn ouranōn*. Matthew consistently uses \"heavens\" (plural) as a Semitic circumlocution to avoid direct use of the divine name, reflecting the Jewish context of his audience.\n\n**\"Secrets\" (v. 11)**: The Greek *mystēria* refers to things previously hidden but now being revealed to an \"in-group.\" \"Secrets\" or \"mysteries\" captures this better than \"doctrines.\"\n\n**\"Beholding they do not see\" (v. 13)**: This reflects a Semitic idiom (the infinitive absolute) used for emphasis. The repetition conveys a state of persistent, willful blindness.\n\n**\"Tripped up\" (v. 21, 57)**: The Greek *skandalizetai* (v. 21) and *eskandalizonto* (v. 57) imply being \"snared\" or \"caused to stumble.\" In v. 21, it describes someone losing their footing in faith due to pressure. In v. 57, it describes the townsfolk's inability to accept Jesus because of their familiarity with him; he became a \"stumbling block\" to them.\n\n**\"Seductive deception of wealth\" (v. 22)**: The Greek *apatē* carries the nuance of a \"lure\" or \"trickery.\" It’s not just the presence of wealth, but the way it deceives a person into a false sense of security.\n\n**\"Weeds\" (v. 25)**: The Greek *zizania* likely refers to \"darnel\" (*Lolium temulentum*), a toxic weed that looks nearly identical to wheat until it matures. This botanical reality is essential to the parable's logic: the servants cannot distinguish them early on.\n\n**\"Completion of the age\" (v. 39, 40, 49)**: The Greek *synteleia aiōnos* refers to the climax or consummation of the current era, rather than the destruction of the physical \"world\" (*kosmos*).\n\n**\"Causes of sin\" (v. 41)**: *Skandala* here refers to things (or people) that cause others to fall away or stumble.\n\n**\"Scholar of the Law\" (v. 52)**: *Grammateus* (traditionally \"scribe\") refers to an expert in the interpretation of the Hebrew Scriptures. In this context, Jesus refers to a scholar who now interprets the Law through the lens of the Kingdom.\n\n**\"Builder\" (v. 55)**: The Greek *tektōn* refers to a craftsman or artisan who works with hard materials like wood, stone, or metal. While traditionally \"carpenter,\" \"builder\" or \"artisan\" better reflects the diverse construction skills required in first-century Galilee.\n\n**\"Lack of trust\" (v. 58)**: The Greek *apistia* is often translated \"unbelief,\" but in this context, it refers to a relational lack of trust or confidence in Jesus's person and authority."

To a first-century reader, this indicated a visceral, physical reaction of pity located in the gut, rather than a purely intellectual or sentimental feeling.\n\n**\"Spoke a blessing\" (v. 19)**: The Greek *eulogēsen* reflects the Jewish *berakhah*. Jesus isn't \"blessing the bread\" in a modern sense, but rather \"blessing God\" for the bread, as was the standard practice before a meal.\n\n**\"Completely satisfied\" (v. 20)**: The Greek *echortasthēsan* was originally used for fattening animals with fodder. In the NT, it implies being filled to the point of total satiation.\n\n**\"I am\" (v. 27)**: While *egō eimi* is a standard way to say \"It’s me,\" it also deliberately echoes the divine self-identification of Yahweh in the Septuagint (Exodus 3:14). Given the context of Jesus walking on water—a prerogative attributed to God in the Hebrew Scriptures (Job 9:8)—the dual meaning is intended.\n\n**\"Waver\" (v. 31)**: The Greek *edistasas* comes from a root meaning \"double-standing.\" It depicts the internal state of being divided between two opinions or directions, rather than a simple lack of belief.\n\n**\"Tassel\" (v. 36)**: The *kraspedon* refers to the ritual fringes or tassels (*tzitzit*) that Jewish men were required to wear on the corners of their garments (Numbers 15:38–39). This highlights Jesus’s identity as a Torah-observant Jew and may evoke the prophecy of Malachi 4:2 regarding \"healing in his wings/corners.\""

The translation \"must surely be put to death\" captures this legal and linguistic intensity.\n\n**\"Dedicated gift\" (v. 5)**: The Greek *Dōron* (\"gift\") translates the Aramaic/Hebrew *Corban*. This refers to the practice of declaring property or money as dedicated to God, which technically exempted the owner from using those funds to support their aging parents, while they often retained use of the funds themselves.\n\n**\"Performers\" (v. 7)**: As noted in the guidelines, *hypokritai* refers to stage actors. Jesus is characterizing their public piety as a theatrical display.\n\n**\"Profanes\" (v. 11, 18, 20)**: The Greek *koinoō* means \"to make common.\" In a Levitical context, this means making something ritually \"unclean\" or unfit for the holy community. \"Profane\" captures the movement from the sacred/pure to the common/impure better than the generic \"defile.\"\n\n**\"Latrine\" (v. 17)**: The Greek *aphedrōna* refers to a sewer or a privy. Jesus uses blunt, physiological language to contrast the temporary nature of food with the permanent moral nature of the \"heart.\"\n\n**\"Canaanite\" (v. 22)**: Matthew uses the archaic term *Chananaia* (Canaanite) rather than the contemporary \"Syrophoenician\" (used in Mark). This invokes the ancient, biblical enmity between Israel and the inhabitants of the land to highlight the unexpected nature of her faith and Jesus' mercy.\n\n**\"Little dogs\" (v. 26-27)**: The diminutive *kunariois* refers to household dogs or puppies rather than the wild scavengers of the streets (*kynas*). While still a derogatory ethnic comparison in this context, the woman's response picks up on the domesticity of the term to argue for her place in the \"household.\"\n\n**\"Crippled\" (v. 30-31)**: The Greek *kyllous* refers specifically to those who are maimed, deformed, or have lost a limb. Many translations collapse this into \"lame,\" but Matthew distinguishes them from the *chōlous* (lame/walking with a limp).\n\n**\"Large baskets\" (v. 37)**: The word *spyridas* refers to large hampers, distinct from the smaller *kophinous* used in the feeding of the five thousand. These were large enough to lower a man down a wall (as in Acts 9:25)."

      "notes": "**\"Sign from the sky\" (v. 1)**: The Greek *ouranos* can mean \"heaven\" (the dwelling of God) or \"the sky.\" Given the context of the Pharisees looking for a cosmic portent and Jesus’s following response about weather patterns, \"sky\" is the more immediate sense, though the double meaning remains.\n\n**\"Unfaithful generation\" (v. 4)**: *Moichalis* literally means \"adulterous.\" In the context of the Hebrew Scriptures (e.g., Hosea, Ezekiel), adultery is the standard metaphor for covenant unfaithfulness to God. \"Unfaithful\" captures the theological weight for a modern reader better than the literal sexual term.\n\n**\"Hand-baskets\" vs. \"Large hampers\" (v. 9–10)**: The Greek uses two different words: *kophinos* (a smaller, stiff wicker basket) in the feeding of the 5,000, and *spyris* (a large, flexible mat-basket or hamper, large enough to hold a man, as in Acts 9:25) in the feeding of the 4,000. Distinguishing them preserves the historical specificity of the two different events.\n\n**\"Simon Bar-Jonah\" (v. 17)**: Retaining the Aramaic *Bar* (\"son of\") preserves the Semitic flavor of Jesus's blessing. There is also a likely wordplay with \"Jonah\" (v. 4) and Peter's father's name.\n\n**\"Peter... bedrock... assembly\" (v. 18)**: The Greek *Petros* (a stone) and *petra* (bedrock/rock formation) create a wordplay difficult to capture in English. \"Peter—the Rock—and on this bedrock\" attempts to show the connection. *Ekklēsia* is translated as \"assembly\" to avoid the later institutional baggage of \"church\" and to reflect the Greek/LXX meaning of a gathered community of citizens or God’s people.\n\n**\"Gates of Hades\" (v. 18)**: \"Hades\" is the realm of the dead. The \"gates\" represent the power of death to imprison. Jesus is stating that death itself will not be able to contain or conquer his assembly.\n\n**\"Will have been bound/loosed\" (v. 19)**: The Greek uses periphrastic future perfects (*estai dedemenon/lelumenon*). This suggests that the apostolic \"binding and loosing\" (rabbinic terms for forbidding and permitting) reflects a reality already determined in heaven, rather than heaven following an earthly lead.\n\n**\"Mercy on you\" (v. 22)**: *Hileōs soi* is an idiom of deprecation, literally \"may God be propitious/merciful to you,\" used to ward off a terrible thought. \"God forbid\" is a common translation, but \"Mercy on you\" preserves the Greek prayer-like root.\n\n**\"Life / Very self\" (v. 25–26)**: The Greek *psychē* corresponds to the Hebrew *nephesh*, meaning the whole person, the vital life-force, or the \"soul.\" In v. 25, \"life\" is the clearest fit, but in v. 26, the loss of one's *psychē* is the loss of one's \"very self.\" Using both terms brings out the nuance of the stakes Jesus is describing."

      "notes": "**\"Transfigured\" (v. 2)**: The Greek *metamorphōthē* implies a change of form that stems from an inner reality. For the original audience, this would evoke the shining face of Moses (Exodus 34) but intensified, suggesting Jesus’s divine nature being \"unveiled\" rather than a mere external change.\n\n**\"Shelters\" (v. 4)**: The Greek *skēnas* refers to temporary booths or tabernacles. This is a direct allusion to the Festival of Tabernacles (*Sukkot*), during which Jews lived in temporary shelters to remember God dwelling with them in the wilderness. Peter likely thought the Messianic age of \"God dwelling with man\" had arrived in its fullness.\n\n**\"Overshadowed\" (v. 5)**: The verb *epeskiazen* is the same word used in the Septuagint to describe the Glory-Cloud (the *Shekinah*) descending upon the Tabernacle (Exodus 40:35). It signals the localized presence of God.\n\n**\"Moon-afflicted\" (v. 15)**: The Greek *selēniazetai* literally means \"to be moon-struck.\" While it describes what we today identify as epilepsy, the translation retains the lunar connection to reflect the first-century understanding that certain maladies were influenced by the cycles of the moon.\n\n**\"Smallness of your trust\" (v. 20)**: The Greek *oligopistia* is a compound word Matthew frequently uses. It doesn't mean a total lack of faith, but a \"puny\" or \"underdeveloped\" trust that fails to rely on God's power in the moment of crisis.\n\n**\"Two-drachma tax\" / \"Four-drachma coin\" (v. 24, 27)**: The *didrachma* (v. 24) was the annual half-shekel tax required of every Jewish male for the upkeep of the Temple. The *statēr* (v. 27) was a specific coin worth four drachmas—exactly the amount needed to cover the tax for two people (Jesus and Peter). \n\n**\"The sons are exempt\" (v. 26)**: The Greek *eleutheroi* means \"free.\" Jesus is using a legal analogy: if the Temple is the \"House of the Father,\" then the Son (and by extension his followers) should not be required to pay for its maintenance. He pays not out of legal obligation, but to avoid \"stumbling\" (*skandalisōmen*) the tax collectors."

Children had the lowest social status; Jesus is telling his followers to voluntarily occupy that lowest rung of the social ladder.\n\n**Massive millstone (v. 6)**: The Greek specifies a *mulos onikos*—a millstone turned by a donkey. This was significantly larger and heavier than the small stones used in hand-mills, emphasizing the absolute finality of the judgment described.\n\n**Gehenna (v. 9)**: Rather than \"hell,\" which carries centuries of later theological baggage, \"Gehenna\" refers to the Valley of Hinnom. To a first-century Jew, this evokes a specific place associated with fire and judgment (derived from its history of child sacrifice and later as a smoldering refuse heap), making it a more precise cultural reference.\n\n**Assembly (v. 17)**: The Greek *ekklēsia* refers to a gathering or congregation. Using \"church\" can be anachronistic, suggesting a later institutional structure. \"Assembly\" better captures the communal, local gathering Jesus is describing.\n\n**Bind and loose (v. 18)**: These are technical Rabbinic terms. To \"bind\" was to forbid something; to \"loose\" was to permit it. Jesus is giving the assembly the authority to interpret and apply the law to specific communal conflicts.\n\n**Seventy-seven times (v. 22)**: The Greek *hebdomēkontakis hepta* is an allusion to the vengeance of Lamech in Genesis 4:24. Jesus is deliberately reversing Lamech's \"seventy-sevenfold\" vengeance into a \"seventy-sevenfold\" (limitless) forgiveness.\n\n**Ten thousand talents (v. 24)**: This is an astronomical, hyper-inflated sum. A single talent was worth about 6,000 denarii (6,000 days of labor). Ten thousand was the highest number for which the Greeks had a name. This debt is roughly equivalent to several billion dollars—an impossible amount for a servant to ever repay.\n\n**Hundred silver coins (v. 28)**: The Greek *hekaton dēnaria* (one hundred denarii) represents about one hundred days' wages for a laborer. While significant, it is a tiny fraction (roughly 1/600,000th) of the debt the first servant had been forgiven.\n\n**Torturers (v. 34)**: *Basanistais* refers specifically to those who examine prisoners by torture. In the ancient world, debtors' prisons often involved physical mistreatment to pressure the debtor's family into paying. It underscores the severity of the master’s reversal of mercy."

The Hillelites argued a man could divorce his wife for \"any cause,\" even minor domestic failings; the Shammaites restricted it to sexual indecency. The Pharisees are asking Jesus to take a side in this specific halakhic dispute.\n\n**\"Hard-heartedness\" (v. 8)**: *Sklērokardia* refers to a stubborn, unyielding spiritual condition—a refusal to be shaped by God’s original intent for creation.\n\n**\"Sexual immorality\" (v. 9)**: *Porneia* is a broad term for illicit sexual behavior. It is distinct from *moicheia* (adultery), though it includes it. In a Jewish context, it could also refer to marriages within prohibited degrees of kinship (Leviticus 18).\n\n**\"Eunuchs\" (v. 12)**: The term refers both to physical eunuchs and, metaphorically, to those who choose a life of celibacy to remain fully available for the work of the Kingdom.\n\n**\"Complete\" (v. 21)**: *Teleios* is often translated as \"perfect,\" but in Matthew’s Jewish context (evoking the Hebrew *tamim*), it means to be \"whole,\" \"undivided,\" or \"blameless\" in one's devotion to God. Jesus is challenging the man to move from a checklist of commandments to an undivided heart.\n\n**\"The rebirth of the world\" (v. 28)**: *Palingenesia* refers to the \"new genesis\" or \"renewal of all things.\" It evokes the prophetic hope of a restored creation, where the world is \"born again\" into its intended state under God's rule.\n\n**\"Judging\" (v. 28)**: *Krinontes* carries the sense of the Old Testament \"Judges\"—not merely legal sentencing, but ruling, governing, and setting things right within the community of Israel."

Using \"master of the estate\" maintains the status distinction between him and the day laborers.\n\n**\"Denarius\" (v. 2, 9, 10, 13)**: A Roman silver coin. In the first century, a single denarius was the standard, subsistence-level daily wage for a common laborer. Retaining the term preserves the specific economic context of the parable.\n\n**\"Unemployed\" / \"Without work\" (v. 3, 6)**: The Greek *argous* literally means \"idle\" or \"not working.\" In a marketplace context, these were not people being lazy, but day laborers waiting for a contract. \"Unemployed\" or \"without work\" better reflects their socio-economic vulnerability.\n\n**\"Is your eye evil\" (v. 15)**: The Greek *ophthalmos sou ponēros* reflects a common Jewish idiom (the \"evil eye\") referring to envy, jealousy, or stinginess. Many translations flatten this to \"Are you envious,\" but retaining the \"eye\" imagery preserves the Aramaic/Hebrew flavor of the idiom used by Jesus.\n\n**\"Legal scholars\" (v. 18)**: The *grammateis* (traditionally \"scribes\") were the experts in the interpretation and application of the Torah (the Law). \"Legal scholars\" better conveys their professional and religious function to a modern reader.\n\n**\"Nations\" (v. 19, 25)**: The Greek *ethnē* (traditionally \"Gentiles\") refers to the non-Jewish peoples. In v. 19, it specifically points to the Roman authorities; in v. 25, it refers to the political structures of the pagan world.\n\n**\"Lord it over... exercise absolute authority\" (v. 25)**: The Greek verbs *katakyrieuousin* and *katexousiazousin* use the prefix *kata-* (\"down/against\") to intensify the meaning. These are not just \"ruling\" but \"ruling down upon\" people—dominating them.\n\n**\"Servant\" vs. \"Slave\" (v. 26, 27)**: A distinction is made between *diakonos* (an attendant or waiter) and *doulos* (a bondservant or slave). Jesus's rhetoric moves from the common \"attendant\" to the lowest social rung, the \"slave,\" to emphasize the reversal of status.\n\n**\"Ransom\" (v. 28)**: The Greek *lytron* refers to the price paid to liberate a slave or a prisoner of war. It carries a specific weight of \"redemption price.\"\n\n**\"Moved with deep compassion\" (v. 34)**: The Greek *splagchnistheis* is a visceral verb, literally referring to the \"bowels\" or \"guts.\" It describes a physical sensation of pity. \"Moved with deep compassion\" is an attempt to capture this intensity."

      "notes": "**\"Gentle in his strength\" (v. 5)**: The Greek *praÿs* is often rendered \"meek,\" but in the first century, it carried the nuance of controlled strength or power under discipline, not weakness.\n\n**\"Hosanna\" (v. 9, 15)**: Retained as a transliteration. Derived from the Hebrew *Hoshia-na* (\"Save, please\"), it had become a standard liturgical acclamation of praise and a plea for Messianic intervention.\n\n**\"Seismically shaken\" (v. 10)**: The Greek *eseisthē* is the root of the English \"seismic.\" It implies a violent shaking or agitation of the entire city, signaling the magnitude of the event.\n\n**\"Hideout for bandits\" (v. 13)**: The Greek *lēstōn* refers to more than simple thieves; it often designated violent insurrectionists or bandits. The \"hideout\" or \"cave\" imagery (quoting Jeremiah 7:11) suggests a place where criminals feel safe after committing their crimes, rather than a place where they commit the crimes themselves.\n\n**\"For the rest of the age\" (v. 19)**: The Greek *eis ton aiōna* is often translated \"forever,\" but \"age\" captures the Jewish concept of the current age versus the age to come.\n\n**\"Waver in your heart\" (v. 21)**: The verb *diakrithēte* suggests being divided in one’s own mind or doubting one's own conviction.\n\n**\"Regretted\" (v. 29, 32)**: The verb *metamelētheis* denotes a change of mind or feeling regret, distinct from the more common term for repentance (*metanoeō*), though they are closely related in this context of shifting one's stance toward John's message.\n\n**\"Cornerstone\" (v. 42)**: *Kephalēn gōnias* literally means the \"head of the corner.\" This could refer to the foundation stone or the capstone that completes the arch; in either case, it is the most vital stone in the structure.\n\n**\"Crush him like chaff\" (v. 44)**: The verb *likmēsei* refers to winnowing grain. When the heavy stone falls on someone, it doesn't just crush them; it scatters them like dust in the wind."

It carries a tone of distant, ironic formality.\n\n**\"Struck speechless\" (v. 12)**: *Ephimōthē* literally means \"to be muzzled.\" It describes a sudden, forced silence, as if the man’s mouth was physically clamped shut by his own guilt.\n\n**\"Performers\" (v. 18)**: *Hypokritai* refers to stage actors. Jesus is not just calling them \"hypocrites\" in the modern sense of moral inconsistency, but is highlighting that their public piety and their questioning are part of a theatrical role played for an audience.\n\n**\"Poll tax\" (v. 17)**: *Kenson* (from the Latin *census*) refers specifically to the per-capita tax paid directly to the Roman treasury, a point of extreme political and religious tension in Judea.\n\n**\"Give back\" (v. 21)**: *Apodote* means to \"render\" or \"give back\" what is already owed. Since the coin bears Caesar’s image, it belongs to his sphere. By extension, because humans bear God’s image (Genesis 1:26), they must \"give back\" their whole selves to God.\n\n**\"Marry nor are given in marriage\" (v. 30)**: This reflects the gendered social reality of the time—men \"took\" wives (*gamousin*) and women were \"given\" (*gamizontai*) by their fathers.\n\n**\"Spellbound\" (v. 33)**: *Exeplessonto* means to be struck with such amazement that one is virtually knocked off balance. \"Astonished\" is too weak for the visceral reaction of the crowds.\n\n**\"Hang\" (v. 40)**: *Krematai* suggests that the entire legal and prophetic framework is suspended from these two commands, like a door on its hinges or a weight on a peg. If these two are removed, the whole system collapses.\n\n**\"Underneath your feet\" (v. 44)**: Following the SBLGNT reading *hypokatō* (underneath) rather than the traditional *hypopodion* (footstool).

      "notes": "**Chair of Moses (v. 2)**: This refers to a literal stone seat found in ancient synagogues where the authoritative teacher of the Law would sit to deliver instruction. It symbolizes the institutional authority of the scribes (legal scholars).\n\n**Performers (v. 13, 15, 23, 25, 27, 29)**: The Greek *hypokritai* refers to stage actors or people wearing masks in a play. Jesus is characterizing their religious life as a theatrical display for an audience rather than an authentic internal reality.\n\n**Phylacteries and Tassels (v. 5)**: These are specific Jewish ritual items. Phylacteries (*tefillin*) are small leather boxes containing scripture worn on the arm and forehead. Tassels (*tzitzit*) are ritual fringes on the corners of garments (Num 15:38). Jesus critiques the performative \"enlarging\" of these items for status.\n\n**Son of Gehenna (v. 15, 33)**: *Gehenna* (the Valley of Hinnom) was a site outside Jerusalem associated with burning refuse and ancient child sacrifice, serving as a potent first-century metaphor for final judgment and destruction.\n\n**Justice, mercy, and faithfulness (v. 23)**: This is a clear allusion to Micah 6:8 (\"to do justice, and to love kindness [mercy], and to walk humbly with your God\"). Jesus identifies these as the \"weightier\" or more substantial demands of the Torah.\n\n**Strain out the gnat but swallow the camel (v. 24)**: This preserves an Aramaic wordplay. The Aramaic word for gnat is *qalma* and for camel is *gamla*. The two words sound nearly identical, highlighting the absurdity of the Pharisees' meticulousness regarding minor matters while ignoring massive ones.\n\n**Lawlessness (v. 28)**: The Greek *anomia* literally means \"being without law\" or \"violating the law.\" It is ironic here, as Jesus accuses those obsessed with the Law of being fundamentally lawless in their hearts.\n\n**Zechariah son of Barachiah (v. 35)**: In the arrangement of the Hebrew Scriptures (the Tanakh), Abel is the first martyr (Genesis 4) and Zechariah is the last (2 Chronicles 24:20-22, which concludes the traditional Hebrew canon). This phrase encompasses the entire history of biblical martyrdom.\n\n**House (v. 38)**: In this context, \"house\" likely refers to the Temple, which was the \"House of God.\" Its desolation implies the withdrawal of the divine presence."

      "notes": "**\"Royal presence\" (v. 3, 27, 37, 39)**: The Greek *parousia* often meant \"coming\" or \"arrival,\" but in the Greco-Roman world, it was a technical term for the formal state visit of a king or high official to a city. It implies both the arrival and the subsequent period of presence.\n\n**\"Consummation of the age\" (v. 3)**: The Greek *synteleia* suggests a \"bringing together\" or \"completion\" of all things, rather than just a chronological \"end.\"\n\n**\"Anointed One\" (v. 5, 23)**: *Christos* is the Greek translation of the Hebrew *Mashiach* (Messiah). Using \"Anointed One\" maintains the titular and Jewish character of the claim being made by these figures.\n\n**\"Birth-throes\" (v. 8)**: The Greek *ōdinōn* refers specifically to labor pains. In Jewish eschatology, \"the birth pangs of the Messiah\" (Hevlei ha-Mashiach) was a technical term for the period of suffering immediately preceding the arrival of the Messianic age.\n\n**\"Tripped up\" (v. 10)**: *Skandalisthesontai* refers to the trigger of a trap. It means to be caused to stumble or to have one’s faith destroyed by an obstacle.\n\n**\"Appalling desecration\" (v. 15)**: *Bdelygma tēs erēmōseōs* (Septuagint translation of Daniel’s \"abomination of desolation\") refers to a ritual or religious object that is so foul it causes the temple to be abandoned or makes it a desert.\n\n**\"Let the reader understand\" (v. 15)**: Most scholars view this as an authorial aside to the reader of the Gospel, rather than words spoken by Jesus. It highlights the urgency of interpreting the \"desecration\" correctly in light of current events (likely the Roman siege of Jerusalem).\n\n**\"No human being\" (v. 22)**: The Greek *pasa sarx* (all flesh) is a Hebraism/Aramaism meaning \"all humanity.\"\n\n**\"Vultures\" (v. 28)**: While *aetoi* can mean \"eagles,\" it frequently refers to griffon vultures in a Palestinian context, especially when associated with a carcass (*ptōma*). There may be a subtle wordplay here on the Roman eagle standards (aquilae) that surrounded Jerusalem during the siege.\n\n**\"Tribes of the land\" (v. 30)**: *Tēs gēs* can mean \"the earth\" or \"the land\" (Israel). Given the allusion to Zechariah 12:12, the mourning of the tribes of Israel is the primary image.\n\n**\"Messengers\" (v. 31, 36)**: *Angeloi* means messengers. While usually celestial beings (angels), the term focuses on their function of carrying out the King's gathering.\n\n**\"This generation\" (v. 34)**: *Genea* refers to the people living at the same time. Jesus is linking the destruction of the temple (vv. 1-2) to the timeframe of his contemporaries.\n\n**\"Broken into\" (v. 43)**: The Greek *dioruchthēnai* literally means \"to be dug through,\" reflecting the common first-century mud-brick construction of houses.\n\n**\"Performers\" (v. 51)**: See translation guidelines on *hypokritai*. These are people whose lives are an act or a theatrical display, contrasted with the \"faithful and sensible\" servant.\n\n**\"Cut him in two\" (v. 51)**: *Dichotomēsei* is a graphic term for dismemberment. While some suggest it is an idiom for a severe beating, the literal rendering captures the shocking severity of the master’s judgment."

      "notes": "**\"Torches\" (v. 1, 3, 7)**: The Greek *lampas* in a wedding context refers to outdoor torches (usually rags wrapped around a stick and soaked in oil) rather than the small ceramic indoor oil lamps (*lychnos*). This explains why they needed \"flasks\" of extra oil; torches consume fuel much faster than small lamps.\n\n**\"Sensible\" (v. 2, 4, 9)**: *Phronimoi* is often translated as \"wise,\" but it specifically denotes practical Steiner-like prudence, foresight, and sound judgment rather than abstract wisdom (*sophia*).\n\n**\"Talents\" (v. 15-28)**: A \"talent\" (*talanton*) was not an innate skill, but a massive unit of weight/currency. One talent of silver was roughly equivalent to 6,000 denarii—nearly 20 years of wages for a common laborer. Even the slave with \"one\" was entrusted with a fortune.\n\n**\"Winnow\" (v. 24, 26)**: *Dieskorpisas* refers to the process of scattering grain to let the wind blow away the chaff. The slave’s accusation is that the master takes profit from even the most marginal agricultural activities where he put in no effort.\n\n**\"Slanderer\" (v. 41)**: The Greek *diabolos* (the Devil) literally means \"the slanderer\" or \"the accuser.\" In a passage focused on judgment and the \"gnashing of teeth\" (often associated with social or legal exclusion), the literal meaning of the title is significant.\n\n**\"Eternal\" (v. 41, 46)**: The Greek *aiōnios* refers to the *aiōn* (age). While it carries the sense of \"everlasting\" in traditional English, to a first-century ear, it specifically meant \"belonging to the age to come.\"\n\n**\"The least of these\" (v. 40, 45)**: In Matthew's Gospel, \"these brothers [and sisters] of mine\" typically refers to the disciples or the community of believers (cf. Matthew 12:48-50, 28:10). The judgment is based on how the nations treated Jesus's representatives."

      "notes": "**\"Handed over\" (v. 2, 15, 16, 21, etc.)**: The Greek *paradidōmi* is often translated as \"betray,\" but its primary meaning is \"to hand over\" or \"deliver.\" In Matthew, this term carries deep theological weight, echoing the \"handing over\" of the Suffering Servant and the divine necessity of Jesus’s path.\n\n**\"Scented oil\" (v. 7)**: The Greek *muron* refers to a thick, fragrant ointment or oil, much more substantial and costly than modern \"perfume.\"\n\n**\"Beautiful deed\" (v. 10)**: *Ergon kalon* is often \"good work,\" but *kalos* denotes beauty, nobility, and moral excellence. Jesus is defending the aesthetic and devotional value of her act against pure pragmatism.\n\n**\"Thirty pieces of silver\" (v. 15)**: This likely refers to Tyrian shekels (staters), the standard for the Temple tax. The amount is a specific allusion to Zechariah 11:12 and the value of a slave in Exodus 21:32.\n\n**\"A certain man\" (v. 18)**: *Ton deina* is a colloquial Greek idiom used when a speaker knows a name but chooses not to say it, or assumes the listener knows who is meant.\n\n**\"You have said it yourself\" (v. 25, 64)**: This translates the Greek *sy eipas*. It is a Semitic idiom that affirms the statement while placing the responsibility for the words on the questioner. It is a nuanced \"Yes,\" but one that refuses to use the questioner's own framing.\n\n**\"The Power\" (v. 64)**: This is a common first-century Jewish circumlocution for God, used to avoid pronouncing the divine name. A contemporary reader would immediately recognize \"the Power\" as a title for the Almighty.\n\n**\"Insurrectionist\" (v. 55)**: The Greek *lēstēs* means more than a \"thief\" or \"robber\"; it was the term used for political rebels or social bandits (like Barabbas). Jesus is pointing out the absurdity of treating a teacher as a violent revolutionary.\n\n**\"The Ordeal\" (v. 41)**: While *peirasmos* is often \"temptation,\" in this eschatological context (the Garden of Gethsemane), it refers to the \"great trial\" or \"ordeal\" that is coming upon Jesus and his followers.\n\n**\"Sanctuary\" (v. 61)**: The word *naos* refers specifically to the inner temple building (the Holy Place and Holy of Holies), rather than the entire temple complex (*hieron*)."

      ],
      "notes": "**\"Formal decision\" (v. 1)**: The Greek *symboulion elabon* implies a deliberative process resulting in a official resolution or \"counsel,\" rather than just \"taking advice.\"\n\n**\"Handing over\" (v. 2, 3, 4, 18)**: The verb *paradidōmi* is the central motif of this chapter. While often translated as \"betray,\" its primary meaning is to \"hand over\" or \"deliver.\" Using \"handing over\" consistently preserves the structural connection between Judas’s action and the Jewish leaders' action toward Pilate.\n\n**\"Sanctuary\" (v. 5, 51)**: The word *naon* refers specifically to the inner temple building, the Holy Place or Holy of Holies, as opposed to *hieron*, the general Temple precinct.\n\n**\"Korbanan\" (v. 6)**: This is a Greek transliteration of the Aramaic/Hebrew term for the Temple treasury or the place for offerings dedicated to God (*korban*).\n\n**\"Jesus Barabbas\" (v. 16, 17)**: Following the SBLGNT and early manuscripts (and supported by some scholars as the original reading), the name \"Jesus\" is included before Barabbas. This creates a powerful literary and thematic contrast between \"Jesus the Son of the Father\" (the literal meaning of Barabbas) and \"Jesus the Christ.\"\n\n**\"You are the one saying it\" (v. 11)**: *Sy legeis* is an enigmatic response. It is not a straightforward \"Yes,\" but rather places the burden of the claim on the speaker—effectively saying, \"Those are your words.\"\n\n**\"Roman flagellum\" (v. 26)**: The Greek *phragellōsas* is a loanword from the Latin *flagellare*. This was not a simple beating but a brutal Roman scourging using a whip with weighted lashes.\n\n**\"Insurgents\" (v. 38, 44)**: *Lēstai* is often translated as \"thieves\" or \"robbers,\" but in first-century Judea, it frequently referred to social bandits or insurrectionists—political rebels against Rome. Given they are being crucified (a Roman punishment for treason and sedition), \"insurgents\" captures the political reality better than \"thieves.\"\n\n**\"Abandoned\" (v. 46)**: *Egkatelipes* means to leave behind in a state of need or to forsake. \"Abandoned\" conveys the visceral sense of being left alone in distress.\n\n**\"A son of God\" (v. 54)**: The Greek *theou huios* lacks the definite article. While Matthew’s readers would understand this as \"The Son of God,\" the Roman centurion would likely have meant \"a divine being\" or \"a son of a god\" in a Greco-Roman context. The translation \"a son of God\" allows for both the centurion’s immediate reaction and the reader’s theological understanding.\n\n**\"Imposter\" (v. 63)**: *Planos* means a deceiver, wanderer, or charlatan. It reflects the elite's view of Jesus as a messianic pretender leading the people astray.\n\n**\"Guard\" (v. 65, 66)**: The Greek *koustōdian* is a loanword from the Latin *custodia*, referring to a Roman guard unit. This emphasizes that the security was likely provided by Roman soldiers under Pilate's authority."

      ],
      "notes": "**\"After the Sabbath... beginning to dawn\" (v. 1)**: The Greek *opse* with the genitive typically means \"after\" in this period, rather than \"late on.\" Matthew uses the Hebraic/Aramaic idiom *mia sabbaton* (\"one of the Sabbath\") to refer to the first day of the week (Sunday).\n\n**\"Gaze upon\" (v. 1)**: The verb *theōrēsai* implies more than a casual look; it suggests a purposeful observation or beholding. \n\n**\"Violent earthquake / shook\" (v. 2, 4)**: The Greek uses the noun *seismos* (earthquake) and the verb *eseisthēsan* (shook) from the same root. This literary connection highlights that the guards were \"quaked\" by the same divine power that moved the earth.\n\n**\"Has been raised\" (v. 6, 7)**: The verb *ēgerthē* is a \"divine passive.\" It indicates that Jesus did not simply \"rise\" by his own power, but was raised by the action of God the Father.\n\n**\"Greetings!\" (v. 9)**: The Greek *chairete* is the standard greeting (literally \"Rejoice!\"). In a Jewish context, this would likely correspond to the Aramaic/Hebrew *Shalom*, but Matthew’s choice of the Greek imperative preserves the atmosphere of joy surrounding the resurrection.\n\n**\"Bowed down in worship\" (v. 9, 17)**: The verb *prosekynēsan* describes the physical act of prostrating oneself or kneeling. In this context, it carries the full weight of religious adoration, acknowledging Jesus’s divine authority.\n\n**\"Keep you out of trouble\" (v. 14)**: The Greek *amerimnous* literally means \"without care\" or \"free from anxiety.\" In this legal/military context, it means the religious leaders will ensure the soldiers face no professional consequences (like the death penalty for sleeping on watch).\n\n**\"Hesitated\" (v. 17)**: The verb *edistasan* suggests a state of wavering or being of two minds. While often translated as \"doubted,\" it captures the psychological tension of the disciples seeing someone they knew was dead.\n\n**\"Into the name\" (v. 19)**: The use of the preposition *eis* (into) rather than *en* (in) is significant. It suggests a change of status or ownership—the person being baptized is being brought into a covenant relationship with and under the authority of the Trinity.\n\n**\"Completion of the age\" (v. 20)**: The phrase *synteleias tou aiōnos* refers to the consummation of the current era of human history, marking the transition to the world to come. It implies a \"filling up\" or \"finishing\" of time."
